About where my path was taking me, and about what I should've been doing.
About your signature, right?
Above all else, it's so that fans can feel close to their idols.

And on the stage of the Starlight Queen Cup, I'll shine as brightly as the sunlight streaming down from the beautiful cloudless sky above us.
And on top of all that, Hoshimiya may have only chosen Oozora Akari on a hunch, but from the moment she passed her life started to change.
And on top of all that, you may have only chosen Oozora Akari on a hunch, but now that she's been chosen, her life will be changed forever.

As we are now, do we even stand a chance?

As you can see, Sakura cannot live without me looking after her.
As you can see, there will be a special event on Christmas Eve...
As you know, the meaning of a ring changes depending on which finger it's on.
As you know, the trend this year is Constellations.
- As you may not know, simply passing each challenge does not guarantee that you will pass the entire audition.
As you're all aware, I myself am not an Osaka native.
As your number one fan, there's nothing that could be more exciting.
As your partner in Dancing Diva, I want to help you.
As your partner in Skips, I'm here to give you my support!
As your producer I have to say, no way, no way, no way!
As you said, Shinjou, Heartthrob Karat has garnered quite a bit of attention.
As you said, Shinjou, Heartthrob Karat is receiving high praise from society.
As you suspect, one of our students, Sumire Gelato, vanished without a trace several days ago.
As you've already learned, on top of the ability to self-coordinate, you must stay aware of what type of card you are using.
As you watch the idols sing and dance their hearts out, your heart beats with them, you rejoice with them, and you agonize with them.

At that time, I had no idea that right after entering, such an amazing stage would be waiting for me!
At that time, I still had no idea that something so unbelievable was right around the corner.
At that time, I wanted to be an idol like Hoshimiya-senpai.
At that time, we had no idea, that right after becoming high school idols, we'd be entrusted with such an important job.
At the audition?

At the summer festival!
At the time, we had yet to realize that each of us was already walking down the paths to our own futures.
At the very last audition, one of the girls who showed up was...
At the very least, I don't want to hold her back.
At this concert, I wish to surpass the limits that I have yet to break and show my fans a whole new Kanzaki Mizuki.
At this concert, I wish to surpass who I've been up until today, （拍手） （笑い声） Nice to meet you; my name is Hoshimiya Ichigo.
At this hour?
At this moment, Luminas is on the verge of making great strides.
At this rate, I'll lose to Ran...
At this rate, the Starlight Idol Festival will end without Otome standing on stage even once.
At times, it is your smiles lighting up the air itself...
At times like this, it's best to look to our idol predecessors.

Back at you, Mizuki.
Back home, I don't ever see this many people in one place even during festivals.
Back in elementary school, I was the girl who took all her homework super seriously.

Back then, Ichigo dragged us here and we ended up falling asleep.
Back then, Ichigo still intended to follow in her mother's footsteps and inherit the bento shop, so we didn't really have anything in common.
Back then, I did a number of traditional arts.
Back then, I didn't even realize it was an issue.
Back then, I had so much fun with our little bouts I didn't want to stop.
Back then, it all just fell into place.

Back when Ichigo performed "Idol Activities", she winked at a specific time.
Back when I first entered Starlight Academy, I had not a thought of ever becoming the Queen.
Back when I first met Oozora...
Back when I was in elementary school, I was the type to get really focused on my homework.

Back when we first started, it's like we were joined at the hip.

Burning Gaze into the Times. Today we'll be reporting on an idol on her upswing.
Burning highlight #1: - This is the first time Hoshimiya-senpai has ever held an event like this by herself.
Burning highlight #2: the first place Hoshimiya-senpai ever saw Kanzaki Mizuki-senpai live on stage!

Burn like the sun!
Burn so brightly you put Mizuki's year with me to shame!
Burn to brightly you put Mizuki's year with me to shame!
Busy doing what?
But!
But...
But acting like an idol was a lot of fun.
But a Demon?
But after a year, I started to think that maybe it was time for me to go home.
But after I came to Starlight Academy, I got a huge boost of self-confidence.
But after I eat, I always go out and exercise.
But after I saw Double M's performance earlier, I couldn't help but think that I didn't want to hold you back.
But after listening to your lessons and watching your live performance, I thought from the bottom of my heart that I want to have fun like that too.
But after Mizuki-san left Starlight, they broke up.
But after our last photoshoots, I saw my hard work pay off and got my confidence back.
But after seeing the top idol Kanzaki Mizuki's concert I fell head over heels for her As idols, we're get our strength from people cheering us on, Oh, I've heard of that!
But Akari-chan, how did you actually manage to get on board with all this?
But Akari-chan, how did you manage to get her to let you help?
- But Akari-chan, you keep your eyes on your goal and plod away!
But Akari didn't lose heart.
But all I've heard is how she'll be fine because Risappe is there for her.
But all the beaches are probably swamped with people this time of the season.
But all the beaches are probably swamped with people this time of year.
But a loss is a loss.
- But also a gardener who can make any flower bloom beautiful.
- But also a gardener who can make any flower flourish at full bloom.
But among them all, this one line has been enough to support me all this way.
But among you all was a single idol who shined like the sun and stole the hearts of millions.
But anyway, I read Green Grass's picture book!
But anyway, let's sleep.
But anyway, Muleta-san. Did you find any hints towards making the unit dresses?
But anyway, should you really be standing around here, Raichi-kun?
But Aoi, weren't you just relieved that you wouldn't be paired with Ran-san?
But aren't the apples in Snow White...
But are you really okay with that?
But are you really sure we're good enough?
But are you really using the picture from our shrine visit?
But as a former idol, I think that she can reach even greater heights.
But as expected, Ran's definitely got the best style.
But as I am now...
But as long as I have rice, I'll be fine.
But as long as we're here, I'm the same old groundskeeper.
But as of today, there is one more student who has left this academy.
But as we did our unit activities as Dancing Diva, I came to love dancing as well.
But as you know, it's almost impossible to get hold of a ticket to Mizuki-sama's concert.
But as your senpai, I wondered if I could've guided you better.
But at least Ran's not feeling down after all that.
But at some point, you started trying to smile more often.
But at that moment, it became all of your song.
But at that moment, it belonged to all of you.
But at the peak of their popularity, they suddenly retired for an unknown reason.
But at the same time, I couldn't abandon our roots either...
But at the same time I couldn't completely throw away our old ways...
But at the same time, I'm really happy that I was singled out for this job offer.
But at the same time, I'm so happy that taking that first step to be an idol led to these burning emotions.
But at the same time, it is but a single milestone.
But at the same time, she was also very strict.
But at the same time, she was very strict.
But at the top of their popularity they suddenly disbanded.
But a unit doesn't end after the first song.
But because of her strong desire to become an idol, she hid her face in order to deceive her parents and friends and took an idol talent search audition.
But because we became so popular, we had no choice but to write songs that would sell.
But before anything else, I need to meet the top designer.
But before I can, I need to work even harder!
But before that...
But before that, congratulations on your acceptance.
But before that, I need to support my beloved Nonocchi when it's her turn tomorrow!
But before that I've got to pass an audition.
But before that, I would wish a happy new year to everyone I was indebted to.
But before that, open up wide.
But before that, strike some poses.
But before that, the most important thing for the two of us...
But before that, you need to give all your concentration to Pon Pon Crepe.
But before that, you need to give your full attention to Pon Pon Crepe.
But before we do that...
But being the Pon Pon Crepe Campaign Girl is supposed to be one of the first steps for rookie idols.
But bentos taste the best when you're out under the clear sky!
But between being suited to being an idol and not, wouldn't you obviously be suited?
But both of these dresses are so good!
But but...
But, but!
But... but...
But, but, but!
But, but, but! I couldn't possibly intrude upon an upperclassmen group.
But but but! We're the ones being pushed, not pushing.
But, but, but we saw it ourselves!
But, but it looks like we need to go this way if we want to get deeper in the castle.
But, but Ran has rare cards...
But... but Ran has rare cards...
But... but Ran has rare cards too...
But, but still...
But by the time we got there...
But by who?
But can I get one that easily?
But clothes make the girl.
But come to think of it...
But deep within my heart I'm truly happy that you won.
But despite all that, what we've really wanted to do is come together to hold a proper national tour.
But despite all that, what we've really wanted to do is come together to hold a proper nation tour.
But despite that... no, because of that, there's so much about her that none of us can offer.
But despite that, up until just now I've wanted to pass the audition, and not hold Ran-san back.
But despite the sunshine, the wind will still make it chilly.
But didn't it snow last year?
But, didn't you just say like real?
But didn't you say it was absolutely forbidden before?
But does Dreamy Crown even have a Premium dress made?
- But doesn't it always seems to be closer than you think?
But doesn't it always seem to be closer than you think?
But doesn't it make you laugh?
But doesn't it sound fun?
But don't forget about Shinjou Hinaki and Kurebayashi Juri's unit.
But don't forget that Akari-chan just won the crown of Starlight Queen.
But don't forget that it was Akari-chan who just took the Starlight Queen crown.
But don't forget that we're going to practice more before the event, alright?
But don't forget that you can only find it once a day before noon.
But don't worry.
But don't worry, I'll make sure to get there in time.
- But don't you think it's within reach more often than not?
But don't you think there's something off?
- But do you really think being alone only brings lonliness?
But do you really think going down your own paths only brings loneliness?
But do you think she'd let us join her?
But DreAca and Starlight are rivals.
But Dream Academy is different.
But each time, I was able to pull through when I thought about you waiting for me.
But Encierro-san has lost that.
But even as we speak, Ichigo-sama, Aoi-sama, and Ran-sama are getting special lessons from Johnny-sensei.
But even at the last rehearsal today...
But even if I do, I'm going to keep plodding on!
But even if I tried to hide it, Mizuki-san could see right through me.
But! Even if they're all together, there's no time for them to practice!
But even if we have off-time, that doesn't mean Sena-san isn't busy with his stuff.
But even if we're not always together...
But even if you did finish up all of your work, you were supposed to wait until the beginning of summer break to come.
But even if you get a replacement, you won't have much time to practice...
But even in her greatest crisis, her longtime fans stood by her side, and at the end, Loli Gothic's designer even gave her a Premium Dress.
But even in her greatest crisis her old fans stood strong by her side, and Loli Gothic's designer even gave her a Premium Dress.
- But even knowing that, there are too many of them to count.
But even more amazing than her is...
But even now, she's still unreachably far ahead.
But even so...
But even so, if all the dresses of this universe were to become jerseys, the world would lose all traces of beauty.
But even so, I like being here.
But even so, our feelings remained in sync.
But even so, they were able to leave their mark on everyone's hearts.
But even though the sun hasn't set...
But even though we're off, don't you think Sena-san might be busy?
But even though you're my honeys, the guest's identity is supposed to be kept a secret.
But even without that, there's confirmation that Yumekouji Maya-san is hard to please.
But even with WM back, I'll still focus just as much on Tristar...
But even with WM back, Tristar will continue as always...
But everything's still in the idea stage, so I'm open to any suggestions.
But first, I need to support my beloved Nonocchi when it's her turn tomorrow!
But first up is making the perfect poster.
But for her to quit her job as president and start an idol school...
But for him to go to this place specifically...
But for some reason, she suddenly spent a year without appearing in public.
But for the Starlight Queen not to perform at all...
But for today, I'd like you to sing with me to support the next generation.
But from this year on, everyone in the middle school can enter.
But goodness...
But Headmistress Orihime personally recommended it.
But heavy.
But her true abilities will only be tested from this point forward.
But he seemed like it was really important.
But he's not here...
But he turned me down.
But honestly, I can't believe you're an idol on TV now.
But honestly, you've surprised me by becoming an idol who's on TV.
But honest, to tell ya the truth...
But, Hoshimiya...
But how?
But how am I supposed to interact with my fans?
But how should I get over there...
But how should I go about that?
But I...
But, I...
But I already went ahead and asked.
But I also feel like a video that's too in-your-face will deter some people.
But I am a descendant of Count Dracula...
But I believed that it was a good idea for the dress, so I went out on a limb.
But I believed that it was a good idea for the dress, so I went out on a limb and said it.
But I believe that there are never fans that you can't see.
But I betrayed him...
But! I brought good news.
But I can't do anything for her...
But I can't give up!
but I can't honestly be happy.
But I can't possibly eat this raw, can I?
But I can't say yes quite yet.
But I can't think of anything else.
But I can understand her.
But I caught a glimpse of her.
But Ichigo-chan is interesting.
But Ichigo, it looks like you have your very first fan already!
But I'd be so shocked if she actually did like Ebipon!
But I decided that I definitely wanted to go to Starlight Academy, so I came back to Japan by myself.
But I didn't audition because I thought it didn't suit me...
But I... didn't do anything...
But I'd like to see abit more flair.
But idols must be ever moving onwards.
But idols must never be late.
But I don't blame you for being curious.
But I don't even know the name.
But I don't have any interest in the girls at school.
But I don't have any of those!
But I don't have the luxury to stop!
But I don't know.
But I don't know what I have.
But I don't know what to do.
But I don't think I can explain it.
But I don't want to give up on my unit with her.
But I'd say I'm not really that talented; it's more like I just love Seira...
But if Double M happens to win the Partner's Cup...
But I feel anxious on occasion.
But I feel like it's a miracle I got to meet you.
But I feel like I've seen this place before.
But I feel like something's off.
But I feel like there could be a bit more food.
But I feel like we'd just be hurting her.
But I felt how fun PowaPuri was just by watching you.
But I felt it was lacking something.
But I felt it was missing something.
But I felt terrible making them worry.
But if I enter, that'll just mean you have another rival to compete against.
But if I fail, Headmistress Orihime will...
But if I had to say, she hedged her bets on potential.
But if I had to say, she would pick based on potential.
But if I had to say whether you're suited to be idols or not, I'd say you are.
But if I'm able to bring stargrape fruit to the world, then I might be able to build a school in the village with the money.
But if I'm like this...
But if I started my own brand, I wouldn't be able to do that.
But if it actually happened, that would be something special!
But if I try out too, then that means you'll have another rival.
But if it wasn't my decision in the first place, I may have given up halfway.
But if I was in her shoes, I think I'd be lonely.
But if mess up and say something stupid Shibuki-sensei, we'll be in your care.
But! If Mikuru-chan takes it then the battle will continue to rage on!
But if not for you and Starlight Academy, my dream would never have been realized.
But if she can't make it back in time, Hoshimiya won't be able to take the audition.
But if she doesn't progress, she'll never reach her goal of becoming an idol like Hoshimiya who brings smiles to everyone's faces.
But if she has time, then that means Rin will come down here.
But if that were true, I never would've become a real idol.
But if there's even a single seat that is unfilled, the concert is off.
But if there's someone who appreciates me being like that...
But if we can't make it back in time, then Hoshimiya won't be able to take the audition.
But if we combine your reference materials with my data, we'll be...
But if we do that, won't we disturb your practice?
But if we stay here, a bear might find us.
But if we stay silent, we're going to turn into bear food!
But if you can get past that point, your normal training should be able to carry you through.
But if you do a positive reading, there's another way to interpret that.
But if you don't even try to grant them, then of course they won't come true.
But if you don't pursue them, they don't even have a chance of coming true.
But if you don't train alongside us our teamwork is going to suffer.
But if you don't try, then they never will.
But if you go to sleep right after eating, your stomach will keep digesting and eventually make you gain weight.
But if you keep biting onto me like a soft-shelled turtle...
- But if you keep your fortune-telling positive, there's another way to interpret that.
But if you manage to impress him, you'll unquestionably make your big break!
But if you manage to impress him, you're sure to get your big break!
But if you mess up, it'll really be terrible.
But if your coffin fit, maybe Elizabeth III would fit too!
But if you're able to pull off an Appeal limited to Good Coords, then it really makes it worth the risk.
But if you read Mado as window, it just sounds like a cleaning spray.
But if you're do, then I'm re.
But if you're not concentrating, those won't make a lick of difference.
But if you're not zoned in, their help won't make a lick of difference.
But if you're really that desperate, I don't think I might not agree not to be a replacement for you.
But if your popularity starts to drop, you'll be back on the streets in a flash.
- But if you spin that around, you get this good fortune.
But if you start to falter, don't expect any more dresses.
But if you want to go home, then you'll need to pass through that garden...
But I get where you're coming from, Kii-chan!
But I guess I was kinda forceful when I pushed the dress on you.
But I guess you're right. I really should be turning more sharply there.
But I had nothing.
But I have my work and lessons...
But I haven't nailed down the concept for your commercial yet...
But I haven't said anything yet.
But I haven't succeeded even once...
But I have training camp, so I'm stuck here.
But I have yet to receive a single reply...
But I... I love Loli Gothic dresses.
But I jest. It'd be improper to say those thoughts aloud.
But I jest. It would be improper to speak those thoughts aloud.
But I jest; there's no way I could say those thoughts aloud.
But I just couldn't give up, and so I'm here again today!
But I keep on making mistakes and needing to have Ozorotter-kun cover for me.
But I'll also get to be on stage with Double M.
But I'll be attending a training camp, so I'm stuck here.
But I'll be fine.
But I'll be here watching you.
But I'll climb higher and higher...
But I'll do everything I can, - It's true that my dream might turn out to be unachievable, - Though I might not achieve my dream even after all that, When I look at Mizuki running headfirst towards her own titanic dream even though we're the same age, Natsuki Mikuru will now
But I'll miss my flight...
But I'll never ever forget this Christmas!
But I love your dresses with all of my heart, so please!
But I'm...
But I'm actually not that depressed.
But I'm afraid you've wasted your breath.
But I'm a teacher!
But I'm certain that if I could wear Sena-san's dress, all my doubts would wash away.
But I'm certain that if I could wear Sena-san's dress, it would blow all of my anxieties away.
- But I'm certain there will be another in full bloom as well.
- But I'm certain there will be at least one in full bloom as well.
But I'm certain there will be at least one more in full bloom as well.
But I'm different now.
But I'm done!
But I'm even happier than you.
But I'm going to be so jealous of the idol you choose since they'll get to be on stage with Mizuki-san!
But I'm going with these.
But I'm happier than you.
But I'm happy that everyone's helping me out.
But I'm happy that I can help everyone.
But I'm here to interview the next guaranteed star of DreAca's middle school!
But I'm just a rookie, it's impossible for me to be like you...
But I'm more excited now than I was then.
But I'm not done cleaning yet...
But I'm not interested in any of the girls at the school.
But I'm not ready for those responsibilities...
But I'm not satisfied anymore.
But I'm not sure exactly what I should be doing now.
But I'm really behind on practice, and I'm just holding everyone else back...
But I'm really impressed!
But I'm sorry. I can't use it.
But I'm still concerned about your abdominal breathing.
But I'm still far from finished!
But I'm still not confident...
But I'm still not sparkly or cuddly.
But I'm still not sure if I'm really suited to be the leader...
But I'm still not sure I'm really suited to be the leader...
But I'm still so far away from you.
But I'm sure I'll give in and eat them.
But I'm sure Seira and Ichigo-chan won't lose!
But I'm sure she's right around the corner!
But I'm sure that everyone has some secrets that they hide from the world Try to find yourself Every day's a special day Let's make our wishes come true I want you to hold me and kiss me It's for you In an instant of silence our eyes meet What a precious moment
But I'm sure we'll know when we surpass Double M.
But I'm sure you'll grow into an even bigger flower and become a shining Queen.
But I'm surprised you were able to find out.
But I'm the party planner...
But I'm thirsty...
But I'm trembling in anticipation for this!
But in all honesty, I didn't expect you to climb up the cliff.
But I never expected that us six would be put together for the challenge.
But I never found an idol like myself.
But I never thought that this day would come so soon.
But I never would have expected the six of us to be put together for the challenge.
But in exchange, we get "off time".
But in order for 2wingS to surpass WM at the Twinkle Star Cup, we need both of you, Amahane-san and Makina-san.
But in reality, the support can't actually move on its own.
But instead of an introduction, perhaps I should suck your blood?
But in the end she remains a kabuki actor.
But in the end, that's gotta be the real Yurika-chan.
But in the heat of the moment I forgot everything.
But I pray that my feelings reach you.
But I realized again how amazing you two are.
But I realized that on rare occasions, I would have this crazy smile on my face.
But I really like Otome-chan!
But I really, truly believe that the Great Starmiya Ichigo Festival will be amazing from the curtain rise up until the final minute!
But I see the fortune in it.
But I seriously can't wait until tomorrow.
But I shouldn't.
But is it correct to assume that you transferred into this school by the suggestion of Kiriya Aoi-san?
But isn't it fun to be able to run together like this?
But isn't it so exciting thinking about what amazing things will happen tomorrow?
But isn't it still early afternoon?
But isn't it still early in the afternoon?
But isn't romance forbidden for idols?
But isn't the audition just to determine who'll be chosen?
But is that really enough?
but is that really true?
But is that really true?
But I still can't calm down.
But I still want Soleil to win!
But I still want to find an answer before the end of tomorrow's concert.
But I still want to know about it.
- But is working on your own really going to make you feel that lonely?
But it all boils down to your own efforts.
But it also sounds next to impossible...
But it'd be a total waste to let their opinions stop our unit.
But it'd be nice eventually.
But it doesn't really shake-shake-shake my heart.
But it feels like Nonocchi and I have been drifting apart ever since we came to Starlight.
But it feels like Nonocchi and I have slowly been separating ever since we came to Starlight.
- But I think I just ran into a fun event!
- But I think I just ran into a fun incident!
But I think I'll try a bit longer.
But I think it's really amazing that you can express yourself through your vampire character.
But I think I've lost sight of it.
But I think you had the qualities of an idol.
But I think you're right.
But I think you should focus on your singing and dancing skills instead of your character.
But I thought you were the one who brought up Starlight Academy to her.
But I thought you were the one who got her to go to Starlight Academy.
But it'll be so much fun!
But it looks like they're reaching their limits...
But it made me happy.
But it might be hard to find a replacement.
But it might not be far off.
But it must be hard to carry the jumping blocks alone...
But it really is hard to make your dreams come true.
But it really is our last.
But it really threw me for a loop.
But it's already the day-of, so the dress is probably made by now.
But it's alright now.
But it's also true that you will be disappointing some of the fans that have been supporting you.
But it's also true that you will be disappointing some of the fans who have been supporting you.
But it's an audition!
But it says we're free to do whatever we want...
But it seemed really important.
But it's fine, since this is our specialty.
But it's fun to work up a sweat.
But it's just as beautiful at day.
But it's just as exciting.
But it's just as exciting as one.
But it's just as important to do the same for each individual customer.
but it's just not going well.
But it's just so amazing!
But it's just the beginning.
But it's kind of boring if we're exactly the same...
But it's like there's still something we're missing.
But it's me who needs to act more like myself.
But it's more than his personal touch of entertainment—it's also to test the idols.
But it's normal for different people to be different.
But it's not a simple task to make an idol who can match her...
But it's nothing compared my gratitude to everyone that I met here at Starlight.
But it's not just our usual work and the New Year's shows.
But it's not like I don't want to go, either.
But it's not like I don't want to go either, right?
But it's not like you saying that doesn't not make me happy.
But it's not much of an autograph.
But it's not much of a signature.
But it's not your efforts that count, it's whether you can or can't.
But it's really difficult...
But it's really fulfilling.
But it's really unbelievable.
But it's so good.
But it's so hard to decide.
But it's so important...
But it's so important to him...
But it's something really important to you, isn't it?
But it's so much fun!
But it's still there. You're dazzling when you're hard at work.
But it's still there. Your hard-working figure is dazzling.
But it's still there. Your hard work makes you shine ever brighter.
But it's such a waste!
But it's the end of the line for you!
But it still leaves me feeling lonely.
But it's too late now. It's impossible.
But it sure is hard to come up with a name that expresses all of our different traits.
But it sure took a while to find this food truck.
But it's way too crazy to try wandering aimlessly around all those cities.
But it's way too crazy to try wandering aimlessly around all thosecities.
But it's weird. Sena-san is taking a strangely long time to make this dress.
But it's within our sight!
But it's your favorite.
But it takes a lot more stamina to pull off a tour than I expected.
But it was a spectacular idea.
But it was because I believed in the abilities I had that I was able to stand on stage and entertain so many people.
But it was because I believed in the abilities I held That way, you won't be lonely or scared anymore.
But it was fun bringing orders to the customers.
But it was interesting to get a taste of the New Year so early on.
But it was plenty good. I even approved it.
But it was the three of us who decided.
But it will be our last.
But it won't be easy going from here on out.
But I've always wanted to slide down.
But I've never been on a date before...
But I've never been one who's good at talking to strangers.
But I've never once thought that it was harsh.
But I've seen your efforts. Believe in me.
But I want to back myself into a corner for this competition.
But I want to be the hard-boiled egg!
But I want to get my message to Green Grass-san even if I can't go myself.
But I want to share this gratitude with my fans.
But I want you to see me as an idol, without any calculations!
But I wasn't able to warn you as your partner.
But I was so happy!
but I was wondering why I'm the only one who doesn't smell like an idol.
But I wonder if she'd let us join her?
But, I wonder what will become of them...
But I won't be able to be a Muse with just perfection.
But I won't be simply handing it over.
But I won't let one tear drop until we're finished eating.
But, I won't tell you what my timing is.
But I would have figured that Ichigo's the type to let secrets out easily.
But I would have figured that Ichigo was the type to let secrets out easily.
But I wouldn't be able to swim like that!
But I wouldn't want to interfere with your work.
But just because it's a little bit higher it's much harder to walk down.
But just hold on a little longer.
But just like that turtle, if you're able to keep biting on to me like before...
But just what did she mean by that earlier?
But just when was this taken?
But just where did the Ichigo who always did her best and wanted to shine go?
But just where did the Ichigo who always did her best to shine go?
But Kiriya has really met my expectations of being a teacher.
But leeks are so yummy!
えっと…　イエイ！ ヒエ～！ But leek's so yummy! Ah, there's writing.
But let's do it!
But let's see if you managed to overcome your weakness or not, little girl.
but let's see if you've managed to overcome your weakness, little girl.
But look at your eyes.
But Mama...
But man...
But man, Mizuki-chan was awesome.
But man, that was dangerous, even for me.
But many things stay the same.
But Masquerade was well before our time.
But Masquerade were active well before our time.
But maybe something about her just "clicked".
But Mikuru gave me the push I needed.
But Miyabi-chan was shining brighter than ever!
But Mizuki awakened each of our powers and we put on the best show ever.
but Mizuki brought out our personal traits and put on the best show ever.
But Mizuki-chan really was the best.
- But Mizuki's always facing all her fans at once.
But Mizuki-san has already walked away from Starlight Academy.
But Mizuki-san once left Starlight Academy behind her.
- But Mizuki's faces all her fans at once.
But more than anything else, because I was up there with Seira-chan, I had a blast competing with her to light up the stage!
But more than that feeling, my gratitude to all of you I met here at Starlight is way bigger.
But my admiration for her hasn't changed.
- But my Aikatsu is not over.
- But my Aikatsu is not over. The fire inside me is ever burning.
- But my Aikatsu is not over. The fire withing me is ever burning.
But my boot is the heaviest.
But my dream right now is to become an amazing idol just like Hoshimiya-senpai!
But my first flash of inspiration, the Smile Dwarf coord, would be...
But my goal is to be an idol who can make people laugh.
But my head is crystal clear.
But my new fans...
But my original choice, the Smile Dwarf coord would be...
- But my singing is bringing smiles not just to Noelle, but lots of other children too.
- But my song is bringing smiles not just to Noelle, but lots of other children too.
But news travels fast on KiraKiratter, and there's a lot you can learn too.
But next time we'll win!
But no, I'd just run out of space." Aoi's my best friend, so this really makes me happy. Now then...
But no matter how many times she tries, she keeps on falling.
But no matter how much I train, I get scared during the real deal.
But no matter how much of that power we used, no matter how hot and bright we all burned, it grew and grew until it filled each and every stadium we visited.
But no matter! I just need more practice.
But no matter what I get, so long as I can feel the emotions behind it then I'm happy.
But no matter what kind of idols they are, the world is centered around Kokone.
But no matter what kind of idols they have here, the world is centered around Kokone.
But no more!
But none of my comments felt fresh.
But none of my comments felt new.
But none of my concerns came to fruition.
But none of that really matters.
But none of them really feel right.
But no one has much of an idea on who is really is.
But no one has much of an idea on who it really is.
But no one is a wizard in real life.
But not everyone here has even heard of us.
But nothing I ever try to do goes well...
But not just anyone can perform them.
But not once have I thought it unpleasant.
But not so much I would resort to dirty tricks.
But not today.
But now!
But now...
But now he's sick at home with a cold.
But now I live in that building over there.
But now I'm more excited than I could've imagined then.
But now I'm my own idol with my own way of shining.
But now I'm really glad that I trusted myself and took the plunge!
But now I understand.
But now, I understand that I need to cultivate my own light.
But now, I understand that I need to treasure my own light.
But now I've come this far and am finally a student!
But now, once more, taking into consideration my affiliation with Starlight, I want to perform alongside Kaede and Yurika.
But now she said that she feels the most comfortable when she's up here.
But now she's risen to the point where she can keep up with your training as DreAca's number one idol.
But now that I've resolved myself to find my specialty, I have no idea what I should do, or even what I want to do.
But now that we're here, I don't plan on losing!
But now that we're up a girl, we need a leader.
But now, they are together once more.
But now we can go see Ran's room!
But now, we're all doing Aikatsu together!
But now you can find performers from these kinds of schools everywhere you go.
But! Obligation chocolate is welcome!
But of course!
But of course! I've already thought up a super cute name.
But of course! She uploads vids of her dancing on the net, and has quite the rep as the Dancing Bolt.
But of course! Why else do you think I made it?
But of course, you must continue to grow and change, much like our students here.
- But of course, you must continue to grow, much like our students here.
- But of course, you mustn't neglect to change from your growth much like our students here.
But of course, you need not doubt that I know who the guest is.
But of course, you need not doubt that I know who the guest it.
But oh so spicy!
But once I saw how passionate Mizuki was, I felt that there might've been some greater meaning behind our meeting.
But one day, as I passed by a park on my way to gymnastics class, I spotted people doing a street dance performance.
But one day I'll be like her.
But one day, I saw it.
But one day I will be!
But one day, Mimi-san disappeared.
But one day, you suddenly stopped saying you wanted to wear them.
But one day you will come to love me But one day you will come to love me But one day you will come to love me But one day you will come to love me kare wa watashi wo suki ni naru kare wa watashi wo suki ni naru

But one month later, his family moved away.
But on particular occasions, I realized that I had this crazy smile on my face.
But on the day before the Fun Fair...
But Otome-chan really is a good girl.
but Otome is the reigning Starlight Queen.
But our colors all clash.
But our colors are all clashing.
But our feelings of self-efficacy outweigh them all.
But our own combo is ok-ok-okay, so let's get pumped up and go!
But our speed and height is just slightly off rhythm.
But our uniforms aren't Loli Gothic.
But out of all those, this one line is the one that has been supporting me all this way.
But PowaPuri sounds like fun.
But Raichi, we need to hurry up.
- But Ran was the one who made me realize how much I wanted to be an idol. - But Ran was the one who made me realize how much I wanted to be an idol.
But Ran was the one who made me realize how much I wanted to join those amazing idols.
But Ran, you're always giving one hundred percent.
But rather from a lost industrial world!
But really, are you serious?
But really, good job grabbing hold of a teacher.
But really, how were you so convinced about Oozora Akari from the start?
But really, I can't believe you're all here.
But really, I'm impressed that you decided to be an exchange student.
But really, I went all out.
But really, I wonder if we'll be able to meet the designers?
But really, so many things happened.
But really, we've done so much here.
But really, what should we get her?
But really, you're the amazing one.
But regrettably, you already have a commercial shoot scheduled for that day, Kurosawa.
But right alongside that is to make it into the Aikatsu8.
But right now I want to focus on the Aikatsu Sensei audition.
But right now, the group you just can't ignore is WM!
But right now, Yurika-chan's...
But Rin always rejects them by saying such cute clothes would be wasted on her.
But seeing you make it cheered me right up.
But Seira always bails me out...
But sending someone off really feels lonely.
But seriously, good job.
But seriously, Mama...
But she also said she's really looking forward to seeing my unit!
But she also told me she was really looking forward to seeing my unit!
But she apparently values inspiration above all, and can only be described as the embodiment of freedom.
But she definitely has something.
- But she definitely powered-up and took the idol world by storm.
But she didn't bring any paper...
But she gave that to you.
But she has.
But she isn't very good at being in front of people.
But she kept our eyes on her, and watching her try so hard made me want to cheer her on.
But she left.
But she only has a week until their unit debuts.
- But she only has a week until the unit debuts.
But she really reminds me of Ichigo from a few years back.
But she's also the kind of person you can't catch no matter how much you chase her.
But she's bubbly despite that!
But she's not just funny, she's got this amazing power to make the audience have fun.
But she's still her bubbly self!
But she turned her scoop into a mic, and is now the current top idol.
But she wasn't in my class, and I'd never even spoken to her before.
But she wasn't in my class, and I'd never spoken to her before.
But she will come, right?
But, since DreAca and Starlight are rivals, I feel like we're probably not supposed to be working together like this...
But since he's taking so long, I wonder if he's caught up in some special circumstances.
But since he's taking so long, I wonder if something out of the ordinary's come up.
But since I brought all this stuff with us, why don't we do it anyway?
But since I'm new to being an idol, I'm sure I'll fail a lot even if I try my hardest.
But since it's important for me to continue being myself, I'll add a sky that I can fly freely in—a me-colored sky, and create a me-colored brand!
- But since she took the idol world by storm afterwards, she must have powered up greatly.
But since the roles Compy chooses are going to be perfect, what he picks is final.

But somehow, something more oxcart-like seems to fit better.
but somehow they balance each other out?
But somehow, this oxcart style fits so much better.
But some sources do say that lightly roasting pre-roasted seaweed helps to bring out the flavor.
But something major must have happened for you to be seeking asylum.
But something tells me Mizuki-san still isn't satisfied.
But something tells me that Mizuki-san won't be satisfied with just that.

But somewhere along the way, that time got cut down to just morning and night.
But so suddenly...
But Spicy Ageha means everything to me...
But starting today, I'm stepping forth on a different path.
But starting today, we'll be on separate paths.
But staying in the shadows makes it feel like we'll learn the bare naked truth!
But still!
But still...
But still—!
But still, as an idol professor, this really gets my blood tingling!
But still, a summer tour...
But still, good job realizing we were here.
But still, I don't really get what's so great about KiraKiratter yet.
But still, I don't think that'll be quite enough this time.
But still, I don't want them to give up.
But still, I'm having fun!
But still, I'm not satisfied.
But still, I'm so frustrated.
But still, in my opinion, that still won't be enough.
But still, it's just not coming to me...
But still, I want to know why she decided to break up.
But still, I want to know why they decided to break up.
But still, let's believe that Ran will come to us.
But still, my performance with Seira-chan made a big impact!
But still, my performance with Seira-chan was just incredible!
But still, one day...
But still, Ran-san...
But still, Seira really, really likes cats!
But still, the way you acknowledge your flaws and work to improve is dazzling.
But still, to be able to compete against the likes of Mizuki-san ranking-wise, I think our best chance is to send a unit with Ichigo and Seira-chan.
But stronger that those are the feelings of self-efficacy we hold.
But super fun!
But Suzukawa-san, who are you really?
But Suzukawa-san wouldn't tell anyone, would he?
But thanks.
but thank you!
But that didn't change my response.
But that doesn't matter.
But that doesn't mean that everyone's had their chance to shine.
But that doesn't mean we'll walk on the same road again.
But that doesn't mean we walk on the same road.
But that felt great!
But that is exactly why I can feel yet unseen potential in you.
But that is exactly why I sense unseen potential in you.
But that just makes it all the stranger.
but that makes it cool!
But that means...
But that means her dad can't...
But that means she'll definitely come if she can make things work out.
But that means that you'll have to work double time with your New Year's and regular gigs.
But that means you'll have to work double time in the weeks leading up to New Year's.
But that might not be a bad thing.
But that's...
But that's a no-go.
But that's exactly why.
But that's exactly why a combination like this is interesting.
But that's exactly why I can train so hard— Because I need to get better.
But that's exactly why I can train so hard—to get even better.
But that's exactly why I chose them.
But that's exactly why it could work.
But that's exactly why the next chance could come to anyone.
But that's getting in the way of focusing on the Yearly Recital...
But that's my Ichigo! I'll support you through and through!
But that's not all.
But that's not the only thing.
But that's what makes being together so fun!
but that's what makes them great.
But that's what makes us great!
But that's why it'll be interesting!
But that was just some tiny article...
But that wasn't what we should've been focusing on.
But that was only a small article...
But that was outside the classroom.

But that would no longer be the first!
But the anglerfish hot pot we got to eat afterwards was delicious!
But the bar was just raised.
But the card types don't match up...
But the daytime moon is just as wonderful.
But the first time I came upon Futuring Girl was long before I knew about Starlight Academy or idols.
But the first time I thought of becoming an idol myself was on that fateful summer night...
But the forecast is still saying clear skies for Christmas Eve.
But the forecast is still saying clear skies for the Eve.
But the Golden Mizuki Chance...
But then...
But then, a person from my agency showed me footage of one of their concerts.
But then, but then! A terrible incident occurred during the Unit Cup!
But then during our last shoots, I got my confidence back when I saw my hard work rewarded.
But then, I asked if we could hold a concert together!
But then I found the story that Sakura-chan was talking about...
But the night is still young!
But then I got lost.
But then I got to don such spectacular dresses with everyone else!
But then I got to thinking about what I'd do if I'm still unable to do a Fever Appeal.
But then I got to thinking about what I'd do if I still couldn't do a Fever Appeal.
But then I heard that Mizuki-san would be there watching in person...
But then I heard that Mizuki-san would be watching me herself...
But then I heard you two inside my head...
But then I leapt onto their backs and jump, jump, jumped!
But then I learned that they rarely had the chance to be together.
But then I learned that they rarely have the chance to be together.
But then I let them see me in such a state—I disappointed them.
But then I'll be a burden on your audition preparations...
But then I made friends like you, and started to change through all of our competitions.
But then I met Akari-chan and Sumire-chan, and seeing how they were running headlong to their dreams through Aikatsu, I couldn't just sit around and let myself fade into the background.
But then I met you, and Aikatsu became truly fun again.
But then I met you two and as we competed against each other, I started to change.
But then it wouldn't be hidden at all!
But then Johnny-sensei said...
But then Juri stopped taking jobs at some point.
But then nobody else will be able to have any.
But then she said she doesn't really listen to music anymore...
But then that means...
But then the audition...
But then the sorcerer deceived him, taking both the princess and the magic lamp.
But then the sorcerer deceived him, taking both the princess as well as the magic lamp.
But then the whole thing with the unexpected sheep happened.
But then when the time comes, you heat up!
But then why did Mizuki-san choose Mikuru-chan to be her partner?
- But the one who blew away my hesitation, Who made me realize how amazing idols are and strengthened my resolve was Ran.
But the only people who knew about the festival were the people in that room.
- But the only thing that's ever made her smile from her heart - But the only thing that ever brought a smile to her heart I'll produce you to the top!
But the only thing that's ever made her smile from her heart was seeing you sing on TV.
But the other two decided instantly how to cover her.
But the path ahead is long.
But the princess I want to be is...
But the real reason I became an idol wasn't to compete against the audience, but to bring them smiles.
But the real reason I became an idol wasn't to compete with the audience, but to bring them smiles.
But the real world isn't so black and white.
But there appears to be a bit of leeway in the ever-exciting Aikatsu Christmas Stage.
But there are a lot of kinds of idols that can excite the fans.
But there are also those who see you just as brightly.
But there are different kinds of kinds of idols who can all excite their fans.
But there are girls who look up to you just as much.
But there are other things you need to be able to bring out a Special Appeal.
But there are so many of them.
But there are still so many left.
But there just so happen to be what's called unit donuts that were inspired by Passion Jalapeno.
But there one thing that's still bothering me.
But there's a huge problem!
But there's a vampire right in front of my eyes?
But there's barely any time until it's your turn.
But there's barely any time until you go on.
But there's just one problem.
- But there's no way they can eat that all.
- But there's only one more week until her debut live as a unit.
But there's still something we're missing.
But there's this huge problem...
But the result we reached together was dissolution.
But there was that year where she did stop.
But there were just as many who were hesitant.
But there were lots of times when I felt really lonely.
But these events...
But the streets are always packed at this time.
But the sun shoots smiles down on us taiyou ga waraitobasu taiyou ga waraitobasu We're friends, but sometimes we have to get serious against each other nakama datte toki ni wa raibaru shinkenshoubu yo nakama datte toki ni wa raibaru shinkenshoubu yo The Angel Arrow...
But the thing is, after thinking and thinking and thinking some more, I realized something.
But the tree!
But the two of us do Aikatsu, you know.
But the weather report's forecasting a typhoon?!
But the whole point is that you can't do it by trying to do it.
But the whole point is that you can't do it intentionally.
But they can only show sides of me everyone's already seen.
But they close themselves from the outside world when they're working on a dress, so...
But they don't come out in winter much, and it's cloudy today so I guess it won't appear.
But they haven't knocked us down as the hottest two around.
But they're forging their own paths by themselves.
But they're still nowhere as hot as we are!
But they said that first-years can enter too.
But they said that first-years could enter too.
But they still matched each other!
But they've said that I, Yumekouji Maya, swallow whole bats and use magic to design my dresses, among other things.
But they were together in Tristar.
But think back about what Mizuki-chan first said.
But thinking back, we did the same thing after we transferred in.
But this is just another hop, step, and jump!
But this island is pretty big.
But this isn't the end!
But this is only the beginning.
But this is only the halfway point of my dream.
But this is the first time the three of us have gone on an adventure like this!
But this is the happiest moment of my life.
But this is the year.
But this is your favorite strawberry parfait.
But this number of applicants really is amazing!
but this one is special.
But this really was a spectacular idea.
But this scene wasn't in the script...
But this song was created for a unit.
But this time, I need to push on by myself.
But this time, I need to push on myself.
But this, too, is Aikatsu.
But though the Aphorisms may end...
But tigers aren't farm animals...
But to be honest, I'm not sure it's good enough.
But together, we can run to the ends of the earth.
But to have a Premium dress made for you, you'll need the designer to approve of your abilities as an idol.
But tomorrow's Starlight Festival will be pretty hot too.
But tomorrow's their first concert...
But to the best of my knowledge, Shinjou-san has yet to acquire her own Premium dress.
But to think we had two idols in this house!
But to wear a Premium Dress, you need to get the designer's approval.
But turn it around and you're unique.
But turn it around yourself into something good.
But wait!
But wait! They've lined up again!
But walking down this new path towards my dream hasn't left me with a single regret.
But we all believed that you would eventually come.
- But we are still very small blossoms.
But we can still do some passionate Aikatsu together, and get everyone pumped up, yeah!
But we can't let down the fans who came to see us!
But we didn't stop even once, right?
But we disguised ourselves, so aren't we safe?
But we don't intend to ask for leniency.
But we don't intend to rely on anyone else but ourselves.
But we don't know what it is.
But we don't want to just give up now.
But we'd prefer if you could just forget it...
But we'd prefer no one to hear about it...
But we even disguised ourselves, so aren't we safe?
But we forget as smiles fill up our days wasurechau konna ni egao ni kakomare But we forget as smiles fill up our days Thanks to you Thanks to you - gyutto shitai na - I wanna hold you tight - Gyutto shitai na - I wanna hold you tight
But we had already made the decision to disband together.
But we have a little extra treat for those in line...
But we have a special service for those in line...
But we have a surprise!
But we have to go on.
But we have to make double sure our secrets don't get out.
But we have yet to make an "old" song...
But we just can't get on our timing and height set straight.
But we just can't get our timing and height set straight.
But we just got worried looking at you laze around like that.
But, well...
But we'll be fine!
But we'll cheer you up before it falls tokubetsu nyuusu ga atte mo nakute mo Even if you have no special news to share nanjikan datte hanaseru ne Feel free to come talk with me - mama wa akiretsutsu omoi ataru fushi?
But we'll make sure to tell her the next time we see her.
But we managed to make him laugh!
But we might be able to do it...
But we might miss the bus again.
But we put everything we had into our concerts.
But we're about to be in a photo shoot. I can't help it!
But we realized that we could change into new selves.
But we're all friends through Aikatsu.
But we're all in this Aikatsu thing together.
But we're in middle school...
But we're still short one for the three-person unit we need to enter the School Festival.
But we're uploading this on the internet, right? That means people across the world will see me doing this...
But we saw you two dancing together the other day.
But we shouldn't just search blindly.
- But we still need one more for the three-person unit we need to enter the School Festival.
But we still need to think about the worst case scenario.
- But we still tiny buds yet to reach full bloom.
But we still want her to go on stage.
But we, the returning students...
But we've already made our debut in Heartthrob Karat's jewelry commercial!
But we've come this far...
But we've still gotta keep at it!
But we've still gotta keep this up!
- But we want to grow as much as we can through all sorts of encounters.
But we want to have as many new encounters as we can in order to grow even more.
- But we want to have as many new encounters as we can so we can grow more.
But we won't get anywhere without a plan.
But what about these?
But what can I do?
But... what could they be?
But what does she have in mind?
But what do you mean by "sun"?
But what do you think that precious thing is?
But what do you think we should do?
But what made me even more happy was that I was able to share that dream with you, Ichigo.
But what should I do?
But what should we do? Even if anything's fine, that doesn't help us pick a topic.
But what's with talking like a wise old man?
but what the heck happened to you?!
But what was with the antenna on your head?
But whenever I felt down, Onee-chan's singing cheered me up.
But when I find something in you that I don't have, it makes me want to sing with you!
But when I find tasty foods that no one's tasted before, all I can think about is sharing them with the world.
But when I think about you doing your best out of my sight, it makes me want to work even harder.
But when I think about you doing your best somewhere else, it makes me want to work even harder.
But when I watched your video, and saw you get right back up even after falling, I suddenly got the urge to try running one more time.
But when played together, we become more than what we are apart.
But when the time comes, you heat up!
But when they were at the peak of their popularity, they suddenly disbanded.
But where's the end, exactly?
But whether the person you choose will actually become that perfect partner is entirely up to you.
But who?
But who cares? This'll be a good memory.
But who else is there?
- But who knows if they'll be able to dig them out from that heap.
But who knows if they'll be able to dig them out when everything fits that description.
But who knows what'll happen next time?
But who would do such a thing?
But why?
But why a Japanese inn?
But why a kindergarten?
But why are you here?
But why are you looking for it?
But why did you come to Starlight Academy?
But why do you have this?!
But why? Everyone back home really loved my concert.
But why? He was looking forward to it so much...
But why, how, when, where?
But why magic?
But why me?
But why pass up such a big chance?
But why pictures of me for Mother's Day?
But why snail mail? Emails are way faster.
But why Soleil, of all the options?
"But why were you chasing after us?" he asks.
But why were you in disguise?
But why would she be here...
But why would the top idol Hoshimiya Ichigo be working in a bento shop?
But why would they announce it only one day in advance?
But why? You were so passionate and amazing.
But why, Yurika-chan?
But will she be alright?
But will the ending be happy or bad?
But with a little more talking, I'm sure I'll find her!
But with all the snow being collected from all over, you might be able to make it snow with a machine.
But with each repetition, I lost sight of where I wanted to be.
But without a doubt...
But without change, an actress cannot mature.
But without doubt, little by little, you're moving forward.
but without doubt, we were first place in passion!
But without warning, one day you suddenly stopped saying you wanted to wear them.
But with you there for me, I'll be fine.
But worrying isn't going to change the limits of what I can do.
But worrying isn't suddenly going to change what I'm capable of.
But worrying won't make me a better designer.
But wouldn't he have been way too young back then?
But wow!
But ya can't let your guard down.
But yeah... I do make cute dresses.
But yeah, you're right.
But you also can't let anyone beat you.
But you and Yumesaki-san have different last names.
But you can count on us for next time we see her.
But you can still see the love the creator put into it.
But you can't always get what you want.
but you can't blame them.
But you can't help but not want to give up.
But you can't just expose a vampire's private life to the world like that...
But you can't just expose a vampires private life to the world like that...
But you'd need a special kind of idol to match up with her...
But you get winded right after we start exercising.
But you haven't even started on your own stuff.
But you haven't even started on yours.
But you have to come! You have to!
But you know...
But you know, even if there are no clouds, there are still stars.
But you know, even though we never reached the hot springs, it was a lot of fun.
But you know, even we can't really find the time to see her.
But you know, I believe that angels don't appear to just anyone.
But you know, I really don't feel like going home.
But you know, it all comes down to your determination.
But you know, it all depends on our determination.
But you know, it's Valentine's Day!
But you know, I've not once considered it to be painful.
But you know, Kiriya, I chose you because I believed you could use a Constellation Appeal.
But you know, not once have I ever found it unpleasant.
But you know, once I realized that I'd be able to spread love to everybody during the Summer Tour, I, Kamiya Shion, in order to give my full attention to becoming an actress, will not participate in STAR☆ANIS.
But you know, once I realized that I'd be able to spread love to everybody on the Summer Tour, I decided to try my best at both!
But you know, Soleil and Tristar are rivals.
But you know that already, right?
But you know, there's really nothing to be afraid of.
But you know way more about fashion than us.
But you know, we've got a little something prepared too.
But you know what? I was terrible, so I said that to her.
But you know, wherever I choose to go...
But you know, you're not the only one who started out here.
But you know, you're the really amazing one.
But you made it back in one piece.
But you never know what might happen.
But you never know what might happen out there.
But you now have to struggle and fight with those same friends for a single chair.
But you really didn't waste any time, Ichigo.
But you're already thinking about the same things.
But you're always toping the charts in the model category, Ran.
But you're just looking for a camphor tree?
But, you're my...
But you're not getting it.
But you're probably exhausted from soccer practice and helping me in the shop.
But you're recording today, so they've probably already made the dress.
But you're so unlike any other flower that you can only be a strawberry.
But you're still against wearing cute dresses?
But you're still lacking.
But your hairstyle was so different.
But your heart was pounding and you couldn't focus on practice.
But your promotional photograph is a big deal.
But your second commercial got confirmed...
But yours is the best.
But you see, I'm not doing well in track, and I've gone back to living with my parents.
But you seemed a bit out of place.
But you should know better than anyone.
But you should really be resting...
- But you still haven't stopped.
- But you still haven't stopped churning.
But you still have to sleep.
But you two've already got your cards after working so hard.
But you understand, right?
But you've been deep in thought this whole time.
But you've got the looks to match yer jokes Nina, so why dontcha try yer hand at bein' an idol?
But you've got the looks to match yer jokes, Nina, so why dontcha try yer hand at bein' an idol?
But you want to join the profiling team, don't you?
But you were cute in your glasses too, Yurika-sama.
But you were different.
But you were so cool!
But Yurika-chan doesn't have any yet, does she?
But Yurika-tan fell asleep right away!

By seeing her friends come out of nowhere, or watching as the White Rabbit falls over before making it down the rabbit hole, Kamiya-kun might find a side of herself she never knew existed.
By September, Seira-chan and I will have surpassed both you and Double M!
By showcasing the spirited competition between the eight of us to the world, we can help shine the spotlight upon every other idol in our school.

Dreamy Crown's Ruby Blossom coord.
- ♦ Dreamy Crown While it is primarily a cute brand, it integrates mature colors such as navy blue into its designs as accents in order to pull out the full extent of its cuteness, so it's - perfect for girls aiming to have that independent feel! The real mystery is the designer. The only info is the name Sena Tsubasa-san, as well as the history of working as Angely Sugar's top designer Amahane Asuka-san's assistant, plus, of course, the fact that they started up the new brand Dreamy Crown. According to our original research, we believe that the designer is quite young...? While full of mysteries, that just makes us more excited to see just what dresses will come!

However, however, however.
However, I don't think our practice will be very interesting.
However, if I simply freeze in fear, then I will never the the beautiful scenery lying just ahead.
However, if you're willing to agree, then I know a hardworking young man who's on the way to starting a new brand.
However, if you're willing to take a chance on him, I know a hardworking young man trying to start his own brand.
However, if you want to participate in the event you must pass an audition.
However, I made one major miscalculation.
However, I'm not a student.
However, in order to allow those girls to reach even greater heights, we must teach them how to run with their own two legs until they're dripping with sweat.
However, it was nothing more than chance.
However, I've got some good news for you.
However, I was able to become someone while in that role.
However, Kiriya-san, I believe that you have the power to give Rei the courage to break out of his shell of doubt.

However, that's all a set-up.

However, the pin can't actually move on its own.
However, there are hundreds, thousands of people all competing against each other for a single position in this ruthless world!
However, there are no idols who cannot use a Special Appeal.
However, there has yet to be a single student to start her own brand.
However, there is one more student who has left this academy.
However, the road is long and rugged, and as this is Starlight Academy's—no, the entire idol world's top idol Kanzaki Mizuki's first unit, the audition will present a greater challenge than any you have faced before.
However, the road to becoming a top idol is a lot harsher than I expected.
However, the script indicates that Alice has to think up her own line to say.
However, the world I had dreamed of every day expanded to the horizons before me once I took that step.
However, they mustn't live within that bubble forever.
However, this year, I would like to allow the idol who discovered Oozora Akari's potential during the Audition Caravan the honors.
However, those unable to use a Special Appeal cannot truly be considered idols.
However, to create a Special Appeal, there are other things you need.
However, until then please enjoy all the fun events we've prepared for you throughout the day.
However, Vivid Kiss's top designer, Kayoko, is on the west coast of America right now.
However, we are professionals.
However, we at Starlight Academy feel that it is appropriate to set one more new unit upon the scene.
However, we have never given up on our dreams even a single time.
However, were I simply to freeze in fear, the beautiful scenery lying ahead of me would remain forever unseen.
However, what I'm searching for is beyond that—the ultimate stage.
However, what matters isn't whether you try.
However, whether I can pull this Constellation Appeal off is up to my own abilities.

I chose you trusting that you could do the Constellation Appeal.
I cleaned the Statue of Liberty.

I couldn't bear to abandon my precious friends in a place like this.
I couldn't become the Starlight Queen.
I couldn't be happier!
I couldn't be happier.
I couldn't be happier as a designer.
I couldn't be happier as their homeroom teacher.
I couldn't be happier that we were all able to shine up on this same stage!
I couldn't believe I got to be the Pon Pon Crepe image girl, just like Mizuki-chan was.
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't be more happy!
I couldn't decide whether I'd be able to balance both Powa Powa Puririn and STAR☆ANIS together.
I couldn't even control myself...
I couldn't even wish my best friend good luck on her audition when she was right in front of my eyes.
I couldn't express my feelings just through KiraKiratter.
I couldn't have asked for a better partner.
I couldn't have completed this dress without you.
I couldn't have done it without everyone's help.
I couldn't have done it without you!
I couldn't have done it without you.

I couldn't help but get greedy.
I couldn't help but get sucked in.
I couldn't help but think of the big Christmas tree that we went to see every year.
I couldn't help but want to give it a try myself!
I couldn't help it.

I couldn't... I never even dreamed of coming in second place.
I couldn't just keep sitting on my hands.
I couldn't keep up with Maguro-san at all.
I couldn't open it until I was really in a pinch.
I couldn't possibly agree more!
I couldn't possibly go to see her off, right Ferry?
- "I couldn't respond since I was on the bus. I'm sorry, too, - l've been thinking only about myself. l'm sorry. Do your best with Vivid Girl!
I couldn't scoop a single goldfish.

I could think of nothing but how I wanted to wear one myself when I grew up.
I curse the morning sun.
I'd actually like to speak about Shinjou.
I'd already given up after missing my chance to buy these...
I'd also like butter, sugar, and cinnamon.
I'd always appreciated those with burning souls, but I had forgotten that sleeping within every frozen soul lay a seed of flame.
I dance and groove to my heart's rhythm and beat.
I dance and groove to my heart's rhythm and groove.
I'd assume that the host Maguro-san leads you some of the way, though...
- I'd be embarrassed.
I'd be happy if you'd enjoy our show.
I'd be happy to hand them over.
I'd be hundreds of times happier than scared!
I'd be more worried than anything else if he were to come in quietly.
I'd be sad if I gained weight from eating too much and couldn't wear my favorite clothes anymore, especially since I want to keep on eating Pop'n Popcorn!
I'd bet.
I'd better put some donuts aside for Luminas.

I designed these based on those and the sight of your brilliant smiles.
I designed this to fit her bright and cheerful personality.
I desire eternal radiance!
"I desire eternal radiance!" That was a bit embarrassing.
I determined that people really enjoy them.
I'd have missed it if I blinked.
I'd have more fun performing with you.
I'd have never imagined that this would ever happen.
I'd have to agree.
I'd have to agree with that.
I'd have to keep announcing new clothes periodically.
- I did.
I did!
I did.
I did a few simple preparations.
I did all sorts of training.
I did a lot of new things, like coming up with choreography and appearing in a drama.
I did. Daichi Nono and Shirakaba Risa wrote about how touched they were.
I did in fact attempt to go request a dress from him in person, but he refused me before I left.
I did it!
I did it once in America.
I did it! There are only 4 steps left to the top!
I did make that promise, but there were times when it really felt impossible.
I did my research and designed a dress that should be perfect...
I did not ask to come here myself.
I didn't, but I had a feeling.

I didn't even think about asking you when I prepared that dress.
I didn't expect her to be this busy...
I didn't find her.
I didn't get it in until right before the deadline, but I'm glad I didn't quit.
I didn't go that far...
I didn't have many friends.
I didn't have much time to make my cereal commercial either.
I didn't know.
I didn't know if that person would be watching me, but I performed as if I could see her myself.
I didn't know Sonny quit being a dancer and became a designer.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that amazing things left you so speechless.

I didn't know you thought so much of me!
I didn't know you were doing public readings.
I didn't know you were in a band.
I didn't make it to the Starlight Queen, but I did my best.
I didn't maybe write one of your names...
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to. In fact, I came because I wanted to see you so much.
I didn't miss the part about the Aikatsu8 results show either.
I didn't realize.
I didn't realize it at all.
I didn't realize it at the time, but Love You!
I didn't realize it'd be you at all.
I didn't realize it was you at all.
I didn't realize I was holding my breath until Ichigo-tan bit her tongue like that.
I didn't realize she was actually feeling that sad.
I didn't realize she was actually that sad.
I didn't realize, thanks.
I didn't realize you knew how to use a naginata too, Kitaouji-senpai.
I didn't really see it coming.
I didn't say anything about your throat!
I didn't see it coming at all!

I didn't think Johnny-sensei had it in him.
I didn't think that I'd get this many replies.
I didn't think that there were any fans who remembered me.
I didn't think that you'd come all the way here.
I didn't think the special place you mentioned would be the broadcasting studio.
I didn't think we'd go that far.
I didn't think you'd actually follow me.
I didn't want to disturb you, but I couldn't help but call.
I didn't want to leave anything on the stage.
I did. Our meeting was intense.
I did so many poses that they're spilling all over each other!
- I did so many poses that they're spilling all over one another!
- I did so many poses they're all scrambled around in my head!
I did some digging, and I heard that they might be focusing on designing the Premium dress.
I did some research of my own on the internet after I heard that.
I did the opposite of what you did.
I discover something new kokoro ga kirari shin hakken shichau As if in love with the whole world over sekai ni koi suru mitai ni As if in love with the whole world over sekai ni koi suru mitai ni Everything seems to change and I fall in love even more

I do not have the right to enter that castle as yet.
I don't.
I don't believe I have anything like that.
I don't believe I'm ready yet.
I don't believe that my sister can live by herself.
I don't care about your excuses.
- I don't care how flashy those Starlight idols are.
- I don't care how flashy those Starlight idols are. - The world's eyes are all on Kokone!
I don't care who my opponent is.
I don't consider that 'being off'.
I don't consider that being "off".
I don't disagree, but if you mix all that together don't you think it'll taste awful?
- I don't doubt it. They were both so fired up about putting a fun concert on.
I don't even know where the other two rooms are.
I don't even know where to begin...
I don't expect to ever be as amazing as they are though.
I don't expect to ever be as amazing as those girls though.
I don't feel like I'm nearly as good as the girls in Soleil.
I don't feel like I'm nearly as good as those three.
I don't feel not a bit somber about it.
I don't get it.
I don't get what you like so much about mascot characters.
I don't have any memories of her.
I don't have any preferences, so I'm fine with whoever's left over.
I don't have any Premium Rare cards...
I don't have any Premium Rare dress cards...
I don't have any secrets.
I don't have anything concrete yet.
I don't have a signature!
I don't have much acting experience, so I'm gonna learn everything I can from you today.

I don't have much experience with acting, so I'm gonna learn everything I can from you today.
I don't have much experience with modeling, but I'll make you proud.
I don't have the right dye though.
I don't have the same sort of image?
I don't have time to deal with this!
I don't have time to play your games!
I don't know!
I don't know.
I don't know...
I don't know about all of it...
I don't know about that.
I don't know about that analogy.
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything about the world of idols yet.
I don't know. But remember what Mizuki-san told us before?
I don't know, but so far, there haven't been any other articles that are scandalous at all.
I don't know either.
I don't know exactly what your fans said to you...
I don't know exactly where he is, but let's go find him.
I don't know for sure, but he definitely was snooping around DreAca, Hey, Kii-chan, come with me!
I don't know for sure, but he was definitely snooping around DreAca, so he might know.
I don't know how high I'll really be able to go, but I think I can keep doing my best here.
I don't know how I'll keep up with your schedule.
I don't know how to put any of that into action, though.
I don't know how to put it, but it's like the training is worlds apart from what we have at Starlight.
I don't know how to put this, Akari-chan, but isn't that stuff for getting soil?
I don't know how Yurika used to be, so I'll leave it to you!
I don't know if I can bring it to life, but my dream right now is to become an amazing idol on the level of Hoshimiya-senpai!
I don't know if I have what it takes.
I don't know if I'll be able to do a Constellation Appeal, but I'll Aikatsu with all my strength!
I don't know if I'll be able to finish it all, but I'm sure it'll fill me up.
I don't know. If it goes on much longer...
I don't know if she even has one.
I don't know if that's good or bad for her image.
I don't know if you're being too blunt or if you're just being you.
I don't know, maybe one of us could be bait...
I don't know myself.
- I don't know the characters, so I'm fine with whatever no one else picks.
I don't know the details, but it seems like you did a good job.
I don't know the specifics of what they have planned either.
I don't know what I'd do if you turned into a real vampire.
I don't know what I'd do if you were a real vampire.
I don't know what kinds of things everyone'll be doing, but we're all going to be marching forward.
I don't know what you mean. Let's move!
I don't know what you're up to today, but do your best!
I don't know whether she's got nerves of steel or is just dense.
I don't know whether to be amazed or say I expected it.
I don't know why, but it filled me with a raging power!
I don't know why, but it lit a fire in my heart!
I don't know yet.
I don't mean the word chain.
I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.
I don't mind, but perhaps someone else might.
I don't mind, but there might be someone who would.
I don't mind, but you've really got a lot of stamina, Sakura-chan.
I don't mind doing it with you all.
I don't mind either way.
I don't mind. I enjoyed it.
I don't mind if you would like to observe us. What about you, Fujiwara-san?
I don't mind people knowing at all.
I don't mind that, but be sure to give it a taste too.
I don't mind you practicing now, but shouldn't you eat first?
I don't my dresses worn by a girl who loses her wits just from a picture like this taken.
I don't need any special lessons.
"I don't need any special lessons." Even though I said all that...
I don't need wings to fly me where I want I'll destroy everything with these two hands I'll destroy everything with these two hands Ignore the rules, and go to the future that we want Ignore the rules, and go to the future that we want Hey, you!
I don't not understand how you feel.
I don't... oh!
I don't really feel like going home quite yet...
I don't really feel like it anymore.
I don't really feel the need to use the internet to connect to anyone.
I don't really get angry all that much.
I don't really get it, but is it some sort of special message just for us?
I don't really get it, but I think I understand.
I don't really get it, but thank you?
I don't really know Kanzaki Mizuki all that well.
I don't really like sweet things...
I don't really remember much...
I don't really understand it, but somehow...
I don't really understand that old phrase, but I somehow get it.
I don't regret a single thing!
I don't remember being told that my life was on the line in this audition.
I don't remember eating candy...
I don't remember hearing that either...
I don't remember it at all though...
I don't see it.
I don't see it anywhere.
I don't see our dresses anywhere.
I don't see Sena-san anywhere.
I don't see why not.
I don't think an uninformed opinion like mine will mean much, but it sounds magnificent.
I don't think anyone really clicked.
I don't think I can do that...
I don't think I'd be able to do another even if I wanted.
I don't think I fully understood that there are all sorts of people when I was on TV and such before.
I don't think I know enough about Starlight to point out any differences.
I don't think I'll ever forget Double M's concert today.
I don't think I'm very leaderlike yet...
I don't think it'll be all that easy to get accepted.
I don't think it was talking about me.
- I don't think she's the kind of person to say anything half-heartedly.
I don't think she's the kind of person who'd encourage you without basis.
- I don't think she's the kind of person who'd say that half-heartedly.
I don't think so.
I don't think that has anything to do with it, but watching you is making my food taste better as well.
I don't think that's possible, even if you're the one asking, Honoka-san.
I don't think that's true.
I don't think we'll be able to find a good training place on school grounds right now.
I don't think you're like a typical idol.
I don't understand...
I don't use flash.
I don't usually drink sweet juice, but this was delicious.
I don't wanna...
I don't want either of you holding back!
I don't want it.
I don't want to. Besides, look at this.
I don't want to drag down my precious friend.
I don't want to embarrass her by pointing it out in public...
I don't want to hear that from you.
I don't want to hold you back.
I don't want to leave anything undone before the movie's kick-off.
I don't want to leave them disappointed after unwrapping it.
I don't want to let Anna-san down.
I don't want to let it go out.
I don't want to live in Otome and Sakura's shadow.
I don't want to lose my friends...
I don't want to rain on your heart any longer.
I don't want to reform if we can't give this everything we've got.
I don't want to relaunch if we can't give it everything we've got.
I don't want to relax until the fashion show is over.
I don't want your grilled mean juice.
I don't want your yakiniku juice.
I do put in my fair share of research.
I do put in my fair share of researching.
I do remember you talking about that before.
I do see your point...
I do. See you tomorrow, then.
I do. The feelings of unity that arise from rock satisfy me.
I do too.
I do, too.
I doubted that I even had a light of my own.
I doubted that I even had my very own light.
I doubted whether I could keep up.
I doubt she's simply here for lunch.
I do understand... a bit.
I do want to shine with you.
I do wish snow would come though.
I do wish snow would fall though.
I do. You can't feel the sense of unity unless you come in person.
I'd prefer a hot spring...
I'd probably just look at what Ichigo and Ran were doing.
I'd rather receive instruction now before I forget.
I'd rather watch zombies dance around a fire.
I'd really like a parfait now, anyway.
I'd really like to interview them, but Onee-chan and Ichigo-chan's expressions seem a lot stiffer than usual.
I'd really like to see them, and talk to Soleil as well.
I'd really love for gardening to become more popular in Japan.
I drink it every day, but I've never really thought about it.
I dropped everything I was doing, and became engrossed in idols.
I dropped it off in my room.
I'd ruin it if I joined in.
I'd say it's one part of our dream, wouldn't you?
I'd say it was very Ichigo-like.
I'd say Kanzaki Mizuki.
I'd say... not at all.
I'd say she's a bit too energetic.
I'd say we're pretty normal.
I'd suppose so...
I'd sure love to.
I'd sure love to give it a try.
I'd totally forgotten that Kurisu-senpai was actually an exchange idol.
I'd totally forgotten that Kurisu-senpai was actually an exchange student.
I dunno...
- I dunno, just translate it normally I guess. I dunno if "cheer" is the best word.
I encourage you all to participate.
I ended up with fifty wins, and you had fifty wins too.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed your Dream Academy Carnival very much myself.
I entered an idol school, and with Nagaoka-sensei's assistance, got to perform in concerts.
I entered a world of Aikatsu that I had never even imagined.
I entered the both of us!
I entered the competition because I was serious about becoming the Starlight Queen.
I envision this coming out as a wonderful commercial filled with their feelings of fun.
I even considered leaving the entertainment world completely.
I even got my New Year's gifts a bit early.
I even got my very first fan.
I even got rare cards, but...
I even got to do Aikatsu with Seira-chan and Kii-chan today.
I even got to eat his donuts!
I even knew that Mizuki-chan was doing intense training where nobody could see her.
I even made this training menu for her...
I even said that this would be impossible for an idol.
I eventually started trying to get myself Premium Rare cards.
I even warned him that he was eating too much.
I... every single day I was so, so worried...
I expected no less!
I expected no less from Hoshimiya Ichigo and Otoshiro Seira.
I expected nothing less from your idol school.
I expected that from the start.
I expected them to tell me about it right away.
I expected to feel lonelier, but right now I'm glad.
I expected to feel lonelier, but right now I'm happy.
I expect no less!
I expect no less.
I expect nothing less from your idol school.
I expect performances that will befit the stage.
I expect spirited efforts from you all.
I expect you all to try your hardest to reach your field of dreams.
- I failed...
I failed my first application to Starlight, and I'm not good at singing or dancing.
I failed so miserably that time...
I failed. Sorry.
I failed the last Starlight entrance exam.
If all the industry veterans think that this is the path I'm most suited for, then it might really be my specialty.
If all we do is play songs we don't want to, then do you really think the fans will enjoy it?
If all we play are songs we don't even enjoy, then how can the fans possibly be satisfied?
If Amahane-san and Makina-san designed our dresses...
If Amahane-san and Makina-san design these dresses...
If Amahane-sensei gives her approval...
If an idol wearing one of my Vivid Kiss Premium dresses were to become the Starlight Queen, I'd be so happy I couldn't stand it.
If anyone can do it, it's Ichigo.
If anything bad were to happen to you, I...
If Aoi hadn't dragged me along with her, I wouldn't be up here right now.
If Aoi-tan were here, she'd definitely call that "something special".
If a strange girl comes here looking for me, tell her I'm not here.
If both of our feelings are in sync, we're sure to shine.
If both of us use the very limits of our power, we'll be able to fly even higher.
If customers start coming in spades like they used to, don't you think it'd help you remember what you've forgotten?
If Double M actually wins in the Partner's Cup...
I feared that my inexperience as an idol wouldn't befit such an important role.
I feel a bit closer to her now.
I feel a faint potential from within that girl.
I feel a faint potential from within that girl...
I feel a faint potential from within that girl; A natural ability...
I feel a gaze!
I feel a lot better now!
I feel a lot better now.
I feel a lot more relaxed now. Thank you.
I feel an idea for your commercial coming up.
I feel an urge welling up!
I feel as if wings have sprouted from my back.
I feel as though a burden has been lifted.
I feel as though I've worked hard myself.
I feel as though this is the place I deserve right now.
I feel as though wings have sprouted from my back.
I feel a touch bashful being called that, but to be quite honest, even I occasionally frighten myself at how perfect I've been since birth.
I feel awful for making the people in back wait so long.
I feel bad for Kokone, but I couldn't help but refuse when she came so suddenly.
I feel confident that I've changed since the first day here at Starlight.
I feel in love with it after I watched you all perform.
I feel it again!
I feel just as comfortable around you, but since we're always together, wouldn't that kind of negate the freshness Juri wants?
I feel like a hamster who's caught between a snake and a mongoose.
I feel like Aikatsu is going to get more passionate now!
I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders thanks to you.
I feel like Hoshimiya Ichigo's voice resonated more than mine did.
I feel like I almost understand.
I feel like I didn't completely capture the spirit of the Police General, that I could've done more...
I feel like I didn't fully capture the spirit of the Police Chief, like I could've done more...
I feel like I didn't know on from off while I was there.
I feel like I figured out what that might be.
I feel like I finally realized something.
I feel like I know just as much about you, too.
I feel like I know what those things are now.
I feel like I'll be able to sleep well tonight.
I feel like I'm dreaming!
I feel like I'm getting a headache, but this might be good.
I feel like I'm having deja vu.
I feel like I misstepped on my second turn.
I feel like I'm just going to drag you down with me like this...
I feel like I'm losing myself in you.
I feel like it isn't quite as impactful as the other dresses...
I feel like it's been forever since the last time we went jogging together.
I feel like it's been forever since we've gone jogging together.
I feel like it's just out of sight...
I feel like it was a clean loss.
I feel like I've been hearing people say "you two" to me a lot recently.
I feel like I've come to understand the both of you very well.
I feel like I've finally stepped up to the start line on the track to top idol!
I feel like I've hurt Sakura-chan's feelings.
I feel like Kii-chan would be better as the mechanic, since she's so good with computers.
I feel like Mizuki-san just set off on another one of her long journeys.
I feel like Ran would tell you if you'd just ask.
I feel like she honestly wants to help.
I feel like she just hit us with one heck of an order.
I feel like she's telling us to do everything we can today for an even brighter tomorrow.
I feel like something's off.
I feel like something wonderful might happen today!
I feel like the chief designer is telling me to do my best.
I feel like the exterior of this place's gotten a bit stale lately.
I feel like there wasn't much difference between on and off over there.
I feel like the scenery and surroundings are so relaxing.
I feel like the surroundings and atmosphere are all taking it easy.
I feel like they're sweet jewels of splendid color.
I feel like this is going to be intense!
I feel like together, we can create an Alice that's never been seen before.
I feel like we can even surpass Masquerade!
I feel like we can keep on moving even further!
I feel like we have everything we need...
I feel like we're doing everything we need...
I feel like we've done everything we could.
I feel like you hang your center of mass too far out.
I feel like you rely on your toes too much to balance.
I feel more fulfilled than ever before.
I feel ready for anything!
I feel relaxed as well.
I feel secure when I'm with Miyabi-chan.
I feel so nervous at auditions I could die, I'm not sure it it'll actually help them though.
I feel so out of place.
I feel so overwhelmed.
I feel that.
I feel that by receiving the title of Queen once again, my daily efforts have been rewarded.
I feel that I've changed a great deal since my first day here at Starlight.
I feel that this Aikatsu8 Election will fulfill all of my hopes.
I feel that too.
I feel the same.
I feel the same way.
I feel the same way about Sora.
I feel the same way even now.
I feel the same way, Maria-sama.
I fell asleep! Sorry, the training...
I fell back into my street reporting mode from Kobe.
I fell for her on stage.
I fell in love with Growing for a dream after I heard it.
I fell in love with Growing for a dream right when I heard it.
I fell in love with idols when I was a first grader in elementary school.
I fell in love with it after I watched you all perform.
I felt it too. Things like the brands and foods we like...
I felt just as happy the first time I saw my CD get released.
I felt like I just had to perform together with her.
I felt like I wanted to do the same.
I felt like I was dreaming.
I felt like I worked with the audience to complete the performance!
I felt like making people smile was the most amazing thing ever.
I felt like someone was watching me just now...
I felt like the coords we wore for our Starlight audition helped us change.
I felt like the coords we wore for our Starlight audition helped us to change.
I felt like Toudou's universe was sucking me in.
I felt myself changing little by little.
I felt so happy savoring the flavor of your words.
- I felt such a rush when I got a glimpse of a world I didn't know about.
I felt such a rush when I got that glimpse of a world I didn't know about.
I felt the same sorrow when I saw her off.
I felt the same thing.
I felt the same way.
If even a single seat remained unfilled, the headmistress said the concert would be off.
If even a single seat was still open, I won't allow us to let down a single one of our fans!
If even you can't find any information on her, maybe she's not an idol.
If everyone finds out that the lead actresses have come to see the movie the customers won't keep quiet about it.
If feels like their presence is blessing me.
If he ever gets married, let's all celebrate together.
If, hypothetically, you and Ichigo-chan were chosen to compete in the Twinkle Star Cup, what would you want to focus on?
If, hypothetically, you and Seira-chan were chosen to compete in the Twinkle Star Cup...
If I accept this...
If I am allowed...
If I became an idol like Mizuki-chan...
If I can...
If I can become a forecaster, I want to bring good news of sunny skies and brighten the days of everyone who watches!
If I can shine my brightest with my very own thing, then it'll help us reach greater heights as a group.
If I can't catch up to them by tomorrow, we won't be able to use Tristar's Special Appeal!
If I can't perform a Constellation Appeal, I'll be sure to lose.
If I can't perform that Special Appeal, I'll be sure to lose.
If I can wear it, then I'm sure I'd get he courage to stand in front of my fans once more.
If I could find it that easily then I wouldn't have to rely on someone like you.
If I'd been alone, I never would've thought about learning to sing.
If I'd been fifty years younger I'd take 'em on as my wife.
If I'd never heard those words, I'd definitely have given up on my dream of becoming an idol.
If I'd never met you, I'd have had no idea how to go about preparing for this audition.
If I don't do something, every idol at Starlight Academy will be turned into a vampire!
If I don't tag along, she's gonna end up living here forever.
If I don't take that single step, then I'll never reach that new world.
If I don't, then Raichi'll take it from me.
If I don't win, Headmistress Orihime is going to resign.
If I fail again, then I'll try the next time.
If I fall over... no, even if I don't fall, if we fail the audition, it'll be my fault, right?
If I get to be a forecaster, I want to bring good news of sunny skies to brighten the days of everyone watching!
If I got depressed from one or two failures there's no way I'd have been able to live as a 600 year old vampire.
If I got depressed from one or two failures, there's no way I'd have been able to live as a 600-year-old vampire.
I figured.
I figured he could just watch it on TV or something...
I figured it would be a great idea to form a unit with her, but when I asked...
I figured it would fill you with energy.
I figured it wouldn't be too bad to stick around a bit more.
I figured out what thanks to your visit yesterday.
I figured that I needed to try harder...
I figured that's what Minami would say at a time like this.
I figured that you'd rather be singing than keep taking these modeling jobs.
I figured that you'd want to sing more than keep taking modeling jobs.
I figured there was more I could do.
I figured there would be more of a scene when people saw their favorite idols.
I figured they might even be part of the new dress.
I figured we'd be running soon.
I figured. You just need to train!
I figured! You made it so well.
If I had gone on as nervous as I was, I couldn't have danced to the best of my ability.
If I had gone on as nervous as I was, I wouldn't have been able to dance to the best of my ability.
If I hadn't heard those words, I'd surely have given up my dream to become an idol.
If I hadn't met Ichigo back then, I might not've become an idol.
If I had to choose, it'd definitely be Ichigo and Ran.
If I had to choreograph something with Ichigo, Ran, and myself...
If I had to pick a single thing...
If I knew this would be such a waste of time, then I should have just stayed home and made some extra cash making artificial flowers instead.
If I knew you were there, I would've asked you to play with us.
If I knew you were this bad, I would have just stayed home and made some extra cash making artificial flowers instead.
If I let such a reckless investigation slide, how can you still call yourself the Police General?!
If I lie in wait for him at the station, I have a high chance of seeing Sena-san!
- If I light the stage up with the dress, Sonny & Johnny will make a comeback, right?
If I light the stage up with this dress, Sonny & Johnny will make a comeback, right?
I filled myself on the snacks so don't worry about it.
I filled the boxes up like they were nothing!
If I lose...
If I'm asked my favorite idol, it's Hoshimiya Ichigo.
If I may.
If I may have your attention, three girls from the idol school Starlight Academy are here today! Welcome!
If I mess up and say something stupid they'll all laugh at me...
If I'm mi, then you're so.
If I'm not able to match up to them by tomorrow, You should get to sleep too, Ran.
If I'm water, then what would everyone else be?
I finally connected after 10 minutes, but they were already sold out, so I cried all the way to the local CD shop, and when I showed them my preorder ticket I was finally able to get my poster!
I finally did it.
I finally found her!
- I finally found the book I was looking for! I can't wait to read it... I'll read it during my breaks Akari-chan's on KiraKiratter too!
I finally found the place where I can be happy.
I finally found you!
I finally found you.
I finally got a fan!
I finally got the chance to stop by this highly recommended sweets shop on my way home.
I finally got to see the real you.
I finally have the chance to test my skills with Luminas-neesan!
I finally saw the real you.
- I finally understand and can now say to you - wakatte kichatta tsutawatte kichatta That we are the same ima watashi tachi That we are the same ima watashi tachi Raise the volume in your heart to its limit haato no voryuumu kyuujou shou Raise the volume in your heart to its limit
- I finally understand and can now say to you - wakatte kichatta tsutawatte kichatta That we are the same ima watashi tachi That we are the same ima watashi tachi Raise the volume in your heart to its limit haato no voryuumu kyuujoushou Raise the volume in your heart to its limit
I finally understand what you were trying to say.
I find her mindset admirable.
I finished my homework early so I would have time to learn more about idols.
If I perfect my walking, then I'm sure it'll benefit my performances too.
If I recall correctly, the committee head this year is...
I firmly believe that Soleil is an idol unit whose name will be forever engraved in history.
I first became interested in idols from the excitement I felt watching one of Ichigo-chan's concerts.
I first heard of him when I moved to Osaka.
I first met Miyabi-chan in the dressing room at an event.
I first started believing in those words shortly after our first meeting.
- If I share it all with you, I might finally achieve the goal of conquering every stall!
If I share them with you, I might finally achieve my goal of conquering every stall!
- If I share them with you, I might finally achieve the goal of conquering every stall!
If I should have that power myself...
If it comes to that, then none of us will use Premium Cards.

I intended to become the Starlight Queen.
I-In that case!
I invited them.
I-I refuse!

Is today another one of your sweets explorations?
I stood on stage as a member of Soleil.
Is to pick our outfits.

I stopped brooding over how lonely I was.
I stopped spending those days brooding over my loneliness.
is to put all my feelings into this song!
Is to tell you about this important event directly.
is to think about who your supporters are.
I stuffed myself a bit too much at breakfast.
I stumbled upon something incredible.
I subscribed so I could keep up on the latest news.
I suddenly got the urge to hear your voice.
I suddenly heard applause.
I suppose I can't let my cute little partner down.
I suppose I can't turn down a request from my cute little partner.
I suppose if you're going to simplify things, yes...
I suppose I'll be graduating next year as well.
I suppose I should just take the image girl audition.
I suppose it might make the fans happy.
I suppose it was too hot to handle.
I suppose it was worth it for Yurika-sama to tell them that I'd suck their blood if they didn't show up.
I suppose I will.
I suppose I won't mind not disallowing you to join us.
I suppose so.
I... suppose so.
I suppose so. It should take me about an hour and a half.
I suppose we won't be able to run outside.
I suppose you could call it a gut feeling.
I suppose Yurika-sama will accept your offering.
is up to me! I'll do my best!

I sure would love to see how glamorous you look in my The Little Mermaid-based dress.
I swear I'll always, always be cheering you on!
I swear I'll do my Special Appeal!
I swear on the name of Aikatsu Sensei!
Is what all your viewers seem to be saying.
is what I'd like to say, but I'm going to give even more than usual this time. What about you, Ichigo?
Is what it says.
Is what true?
Is what what you were doing in your room?
Is where we enjoy ourselves tonight and get pumped up for tomorrow's Unit Cup.
Is your sister an idol?
Is your stomach that reliable?
Is you sister an idol?

It actually fell apart right before we finished it the first time.
I take it you've picked a new member for Tristar?
I talked it over with Grandma.
I talked with Akari-chan.
I talking it over with Grandma.
It all begins atop this celebratory stage.
It all begins with the recording for your song.
It all comes down to my skills as an idol.
It all comes down to their ability to accurately find who their best match is.
It all comes down to this treasure box.
It all feels so surreal.
It all looks so good!
It all looks so good! Let's dig in!
It all rests on my shoulders.
It all rests on our shoulders.
It all started when I met a certain clown...
It all started when I saw Mizuki-san's concert.
It all starts with letting our potato Aikatsu power shine through on stage today!
It all starts with turning our potato Aikatsu power to the max for this performance!
It almost feels like I'm dreaming.
It also allows you to easily organize your schedule.
It also helps you organize your schedule.
It also needs a red ribbon right here to accent the coord and bring it all together.
It appears Alice has won, my Queen.
It appears her place has been calculated.
It appears that Master was simply in the mood for tea.
It appears that Soleil is having a concert.
It appears that the first four concerts were a huge hit with the fans.

It balances the waffle's sweetness out really well.
It became a wonderful summer memory just like Aoi-chan said it would.
It befits Fujiwara-honey to end things with a competition.
It began out of her admiration for Masquerade.
It began when I was inspired from one of Mizuki-sama's shows.
It began when one of Mizuki-sama's shows inspired me to become an idol.
It began when she was young.
It blew me away.
It bloomed! And look how pretty it is!
- It blooms brilliantly and returns happiness back to everyone.
It blooms brilliantly and then repays us all with happiness.
It blows the loneliness away!
It blows the sadness away!
It brings back a lot of memories.
It brings back memories of the breeze of Andalusia.
It brings back the feelings I had back when you were a legend.
It brings out your cute inner charm to match your outward coolness.
It builds publicity for the publication or show, so it happens pretty often.
It came!
It came as a shock.
へぇ～。 - It came, Otome-chan!
It came to me after hearing everyone cheer us on.
It came to me after watching the concert, you know?
It came to me when I saw you on that slide.
It came with a message.
It came with a message from the designer, Kayoko.
It can be said that what the fans seek is the effort itself.
- It can only be tilled once a year.
It can't be... all the clothes in my closet...
It can't be... in any case, why are you telling me?
It can't be... in any case, why are you telling me this?
It can't be Sena-san.
It can't come soon enough.
It can tell that, too?
It certainly does calm the heart.
It certainly does suit the two of you.
It certainly draws much interest.
It certainly is.
It certainly is about the right time.
It certainly is girly and cute.
It certainly isn't boring.
It certainly isn't easy.
It certainly is something Headmistress Orihime would do.
It certainly was.
It cleared up! The sunlight is perfect!
It comes from "twin wings".
It completely goes against her image as the Beautiful Blade, after all.
It contains all our feelings of love for DreAca.
It contains the entirety of our academy's history and pride.
It could be nice to have a pose that stood out from the rest.
It couldn't be!
It couldn't be...
It couldn't be cuter!
It couldn't be Sena-san.
It could only be a trick of fate.
It counts.
It'd almost be a waste to eat it.
It'd be a lie to say that there isn't anything I'm worried about in the dance, but when I hear their voices...
It'd be a waste if these photos were kept between us.
It'd be a waste if they were the only one who get to see.
It'd be best if she was around to plan the send-off.
It'd be best if she were around to plan the send-off.
It'd be good for us if she could stay, If you wish with passion, then anything is possible!
It'd be great if all three of us could pass.
It'd be great if someone just struck you, love-at-first-sight style.
It'd be great if someone struck you like love at first sight.
It'd be great if we could shine like you all one day.
It'd be great if we found something that we could only pull off together.
It'd be lame if I asked her over the phone.
It'd be lovely if it snowed!
It'd be my loss if I didn't let such stylish girls in.
It'd be nice if Kii-chan could go see him.
It'd be nice if we could.
It'd be nice if your pose stood out among the rest though.
It'd be nice to give a feeling of comfort.
- It'd be so cool if you got to be the Pon Pon crepe campaign girl! Rooting for you!
It'd be something special, wouldn't it?
It'd be strange for the Starlight Queen not to perform.
It depends on how strong your feelings are.
It'd help if we had a big speaker too.
It didn't happen when we decided to take this audition.
It didn't seem as though her performance was particularly skilled, but maybe I missed something?
It didn't seem as though her performance was particularly skillful. Maybe I missed something?
It didn't seem that way to me.
It didn't strike me as new.
It didn't work.
It'd look so great on you, Miyabi-chan.
It does!
It does.
It doesn't air until next week, but as the actors, we get special access.
It doesn't, and stop adding -chan!
It doesn't even have to be STAR☆ANIS...
It doesn't feel like it's our first time.
It doesn't give off the smell of marriage at all.
It doesn't have to be big...
It doesn't look like anyone really understands what Kurebayashi-senpai is trying to say.
It doesn't matter if we mess up out there.
It doesn't matter who I'm acting with.
It doesn't matter who wins tomorrow.
It doesn't really fit him.
It doesn't really matter if you like her or not.
It doesn't say anything about the outfit itself, though.
It doesn't say anything about the specifics, though.
It doesn't show at all, though.
It doesn't sound like me at all!
It does sound friendly, but still...
It does... sound fun.
It does sound like fun, but you know...
It does sound like the perfect set for your upcoming performance.
It draws me back again and again.
It draws out your cute side.
It'd slipped my mind.
It'd sure be nice if it snowed this year.
It embodies the little devil coord made to stimulate your inner maiden.
It encompasses this entire cruise.
It even brought a smile to my face, too.
It even got me in the mood to study up on comedy.
It even made me happy!
It expresses each of us within a unified design.
It expresses exactly how she is.
It expresses Rin-chan's love of dance.
It express our differences within a unified design.
It feels a bit strange to have you call me by that name.
It feels a lot tighter and cool.
- It feels as if we needed enough courage to go on an adventure to meet the designer directly.
It feels as though there's a nice wind blowing through the academy.
It feels great!
It feels great.
It feels impertinent even to consider giving you advice.
It feels impertinent to even consider giving you advice.
It feels like a dream.
It feels like a dream to be in a unit with you.
It feels like a festival in here.
It feels like an autograph!
It feels like he never left in the first place.
It feels like I can hear my fans' voices.
It feels like if I'm with you, there's no doubt we'll find it.
It feels like I'm in the clouds whenever I think about Hoshimiya-senpai.
It feels like I'm missing something.
It feels like I saw you just last week.
It feels like it just began, too.
It feels like it makes the new year.
It feels like it's calling me sou yobareru kanji It feels like it's calling me sou yobareru kanji Coincidence bordering on miracle unmei teki guuzen Coincidence bordering on miracle unmei teki guuzen Even Cupid's head over heels kyupiddo mo hai tenshon Even Cupid's head over heels kyupiddo mo hai tenshon
It feels like I've caught sight of my answer.
It feels like just yesterday she transferred in.
It feels like just yesterday that we were in Hokkaido...
It feels like my day's not complete unless we do it at least once.
It feels like my heart is trying to beat out of my chest.
It feels like my heart's going to jump out of my chest.
It feels like seeing them live was just a dream.
It feels like she finally broke out of her shell.
It feels like she transferred in just the other day.
It feels like something's missing.
It feels like something's off.
It feels like such a waste to have a room this nice all to myself.
It feels like that's the first time I've really been praised.
It feels like the Aikatsu Sensei's words heat the room right up.
It feels like the answer was under our noses the whole time.
It feels like the room heats up as soon as the Aikatsu Sensei opens her mouth.
- It feels like things are going to get busy from now on.
It feels like this is a place for new beginnings.
It feels like this is where things get their start.
It feels like today's UV index must be high.
It feels like we just left Hokkaido for Starlight Academy, but it's almost Christmas.
It feels like yesterday she was struggling her heart out just to achive a single Special Appeal.
It feels like you're always reading that magazine.
It feels like Yurika-chan is setting all the trends now.
It feels really good taking this road to the hotel you're staying at.
It feels really good when you make an idol with a packed schedule smile.
It feels relaxing.
It feels so funny saying Happy New Year even though it's not even Christmas.
It feels so funny saying "Happy New Year" when it's not even Christmas yet.
It fell to pieces!
It felt as if the weight of the world left my shoulders.
It felt great to be on stage again.
It felt like if Soleil were a sunflower in full bloom, I was no more than some hamster's snack.
It felt like someone was watching me just then...
It felt realer than real.
It felt so good!
It fills me with happiness.
It finally feels like you've come back to us.
It fits his naughtiness to a T and is crazy fresh.
It fits me perfectly!
It fits Otome-chan to a T!
It fits us way better than sitting around contemplating.
It fits you to a T!
It gave me goosebumps!
It gave me the urge to sing more, and to polish my skills to a new level.
It gave off the scent of an idol!
It gets me that "so it's come to this" feeling.
It gets my recommendation!
It gives me goosebumps just thinking about it!
It gives off an air of refinement.
It gives off a refined and mature air.
It gives you a shot in the arm and a boost to your brain!
It goes by the name of...
It goes great with rice!
It goes to show how hard you all worked.
It goes without saying that each one of them is shining, They encountered, inspired, and pushed each other to be their best.
It goes without saying that idols from Dream Academy will also be participating.
It goes without saying that once you become an idol, you've gotta go-go-go for it!
It goes without saying that tomorrow's performances will be the main attraction.
It got quite exhausting at times.
It had a cute wrapping just like a present.
It had cute packaging, like a present.
I thank you as well. She's providing my Starlight students an incentive to grow.
I thank you for coming.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
It happened long ago.
It happened! The number one spot has been toppled!
It happened! The number one spot has been wrested away!
It happened to you too?
It happened. We really are upperclassmen now.
It happened when Yotsuba-san was having trouble creating a new type of donut.
It happened when you were in America.
It happens. Sometimes I accidentally eat too much food and snacks, too.
It happens to me when I dance too.
It has?
It has a calming feel about it.
It has a cool and elegant design, yet I can feel a warmth hidden within.
It has a great personal significance to her.

It has a mysterious appeal, with sparkling power seemingly radiating from it.
It has a nice fragrance.
It has been?
It has been a while, Akari-chan.
It has been called the "Ten Centimeter Universe".
It has been years since they last graced the stage together.
It has eight points.
It has everything to do with me!
It has great personal significance to her.
It has nothing to do with you.
It hasn't been announced yet, but I'm storing vampiric power so that I'll be ready at any time.
It hasn't been long, but you've improved a huge amount.
It hasn't been that long since you joined Starlight Academy, but you performed well on such a big stage.
It hasn't been that long since you joined Starlight Academy, but you were able to take up such a big stage.
It hasn't even been one minute yet.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.
It has quite the deep flavor.
It has to be fun to look at.
It has to be, if you say so...
It has to be top secret!
I, the Chief Manager Tsukikage, will now outline the plans for Mizuki Kanzaki's Premium Shiny Stage concert.
I, the dancing detective Carmen, have seen right through your evil deeds!
It helps publicity for the publication or show, so it happens pretty often.
It helps to chill your utensils in a fridge beforehand.
It helps us relax.
I think.
I think all the dreams I have are supporting me too.
I think he means Mizuki-chan.
I think her name was...
I think Hinaki-chan might be beating herself up about something.
I think I can clear my viewer's feelings through my weather forecast.
I think I can clear up my viewers' feelings through my weather forecast.
I think I can imagine that perfectly.
I think I can see why.

I think I really got a me-colored dress.
I think I remember it being for pair units.

I think it must be used to people.
I think it's a blackout.
I think it's about time, don't you?
I think it's a friendly one on the whole.
I think it's a good thing they found something they want to do.
I think it's all the dreams I have that are pushing me forward too.
I think it's amazing you can even tell the difference between them.
I think it's fine.
I think it's fine as it is, but maybe...
I think it's fine if the feelings are just one-sided.
I think it's fine to be distinctive, but if you think it's too stiff then you can shorten it.
I think it's great!
I think it's great.
I think it's great to have something you love with all your heart.
I think it should be a cute room with chocolate and candy set into the walls.

I think so too.
I think that about covers the basics.
I think that finding your partner is the first half.
I think that Miyabi-chan didn't get angry because she understands Kokone-chan didn't mean any harm.
I think that research really does suit me best.
I think that's a bit off.
I think that's a good idea too.
I think that's a great idea.
I think that's awesome!
I think that something big must've happened to change Mizuki-chan that year.

I think you should pick somebody else to join your unit.
I think you've got the right idea.
- I think you've outgrown calling me that.
It hit me after I heard the fortune teller speak.
I thoroughly explained to him exactly why I wouldn't be able to make due without his help.
I thought about how, as DreAca's representative, I had to shine the brightest and light the festival up.
I thought about letting you know, but I didn't want to scare you.
I thought about the best method we could use to fulfill the dreams of girls who love Aikatsu dresses.

I thought I'd see you tonight.
I thought, "I love these clothes!" I thought that I wanted to change to become a person who befit those clothes...
I thought I might not be cut out to become an idol.
I thought I said not to worry yourself over me.
I thought it'd be more of a "choco-choco" kind of drama.
I thought it might be a bit too salty.
I thought I told you not to add -chan.
I thought I told you not to carelessly call out to me?
I thought it was about time to gather everyone together for some much needed man time.
I thought it was so strange.
I thought it would improve our teamwork.
I thought I was prepared, but seeing them live left me speechless.
I thought Madoka-chan and I had voice training then.
I thought me and Madoka-chan had voice training then.
- I thought of so many poses that it all got mixed up in my head, - I just thought up so many poses that my head became a mess, I can't get her off my mind.
I thought of so many poses that they all got mixed up in my head, and I'm worried about Hinaki-chan too, so I'm out here getting some fresh air.
I thought so.
I thought so even after I saw her just that one time.
I thought so even from when I first saw her concert.
I thought so too.
I thought that I could be myself if I wore those clothes.
I thought that I had nothing in comparison.
I thought that I might get lost in the city and start to freak out.
I thought that I might not be ready to be a weather forecaster.
I thought that it'd be embarrassing for people to know.
I thought that it was because Mizuki-chan was a prodigy that she was so good.
I thought that I wanted to continue it forever.
I thought that I was surviving on my own strengths, but really, it was only thanks to Mizuki that I've been keeping up.
I thought that I would just give up on them forever.
I thought that might happen, so I saved you some fried chicken!
I thought that might happen, so I save you some fried chicken!
I thought that my fans might like it if I gave them out tomorrow.
I thought that the star I was aiming for was you.
I thought that the way Mizuki brings smiles to so many people at once was really incredible.
I thought that this might happen.
I thought that you'd go back to America after Mizuki-san left us.
I thought that you wouldn't be able to do anything without me, but you've really grown.
I thought the same thing!
I thought the same thing.
I thought the same thing! And besides, aren't we already like that?
I thought those two were like oil and vinegar at first, but now they mix perfectly together.
I thought those two were like oil and water at first, but now they mix perfectly together.
I thought you'd be able to give her your support.
I thought you'd come.
I thought you'd come here.
I thought you didn't like it...
I thought you might be feeling a bit down, but the flower in your heart is always in bloom.
I thought you might be her when I saw you on the boat.
I thought you might feel better after a bit of exercise.
I thought you might not be able to sleep without your pillow!
I thought you pulled it off perfectly.
I thought your shoot didn't end until this evening.
I thought you weren't going to eat it!
I thought you were really skilled.
I thought you were taking off from lessons for the week.
I thought you wouldn't stop her.
It is!
It is.
It is...
It is as you say...
It is because I'm not yet the sun?
It is because muses existed that artists were able to create their masterpieces.
It is because of those experiences that I can proudly call myself a chef.
It is facing and overcoming difficulty that makes one an idol.
It is finally time for our confrontation.
It is! I'm cleansing!
It is! It bugs her so much that she doesn't have that one issue!
It is! It's a Special Audition after all.
It is March after all. The third-years are graduating.
It is my duty to make shops flourish.
It is normally a competition that begins with a mad dash out of the shrine gates This year, we renamed it the Lucky Idol Race Are you planning to place first and get a Constellation Dress too?
It is not fine!
It is not for the feeling of triumph over other idols that I march on, but rather the happiness that I attain from the pursuit of self-betterment.
It is now time to reveal those among you who have proven themselves worthy of becoming part of the new unit.
It isn't?
It isn't a road for just you to fly from.
It is only when you complete a Premium dress that you can be proud of that you become a true top designer.
It is... Passion Jalapeno!
It is possible to make it, but only if time allows for your travel.
It is simply a hunch.
It is that dream that gave you strength.
It is time for me to return to my home.
It is time to announce the results of the audition.
It is time. You're up next, Fujiwara-san.
It is true that jerseys are an irreplaceable garment.

It is with great pleasure that I announce the Starlight Queen Cup commemorative concert's guest.
It is with great pleasure that I announce the Starlight Queen Cup commemorative concert's guest: However, at the close of the Twinkle Star Cup WM disbanded.
It is your job as idols to convey those emotions from the stage to your audience.
It just came to me after watching the concert, you know?
It just feels right when they're all together.
It just feels so right with the three of us going up as PowaPuri.
It just goes to show how close you are.
It just goes to show how hard Ichigo's been working.

"It just happened", as in "somehow the Constellation Appeal just happened".
"It just happened" things?
It just kinda happened.
It just la-la-lulls you to sleep.
It just looked so good I couldn't help but take a nibble.
It just means that we're not quite there yet.
It just means that we're seniors that they can chase after.
It just means you that were really focusing.
It just screams "Akari-chan"!
It just screams delicious!
It just sort of happened.
It just sounded really fun.
It keeps moving around and around.
It kept me up at night imagining what she'd be like.
It kept me up at night imagining who that girl would be.
It kinda feels like it's lacking some real spice.
It kinda feels like we're adults.
It kinda hurts, but I'm happy!
It kinda makes you feel more like an adult.
It kind of makes me feel better now that you've said that.
It lays out the overall structure of the show, as well as what each guest is going to be asked.
It left us speechless.
It literally means "Early, isn't it?" So it isn't strange no matter what time it is.
It'll be a big loss to have Hoshimiya leave us.
It'll be about me visiting the international police organization Interpol's HQ, so I'm going to do some shoots overseas!
It'll be a good commemorative photo!

It'll be fun!
It'll be fun.
It'll be hard, but we can't afford to lose here.
It'll be hard for such good friends as yourselves to compete like this, but try hard all the same.
It'll be hard to find a tree like this.
It'll be hard to find space in your jam-packed schedule, but I'll find you a time.

- It'll be your first time over, after all.

It might be best to wait until after everyone's songs are done before bringing them in.
It might be best to wait until after everyone's songs are done before bringing these.
It might be better for you to see it firsthand than to hear me explain.
It might be better to make the light a bit softer.
It might be difficult do this so last minute, but we could call up Juri's father and ask him to come up with a special meal using jalapenos.
- It might be difficult since we're going to be even busier with work.
It might be difficult to plan so last minute, I think we might be able to create something completely new by combining Spanish and Mexican cuisine.

I totally understand your feelings!
I totes want you to wear it!
I touched it!
I touched it.
- It perfectly describes Sumire-senpai's amazing singing.
It pretty much means whatever happens, happens.

It's been a while. I'm Hoshimiya Ichigo.
It's been a while since I've gotten a bus ticket like this.
It's been a while since I've seen you two.
It's been a while since someone's climbed up.
It's been a while since we could relax like this.
It's been a while since we've had the face-planting rookie on set.
It's been a while since we've stood on the same stage.
It's been a while since you three had a gig together.
It's been a whole two years.
It's been decided!
It's been fifty whole years.
It's been forever since I've had your homemade cookies!
It's been fun.
It's been here since before I was even born.
It's been here since even before I was born.
It's been literally years since the last time they graced the stage together.
It's been many decades since I last saw the Starlight Tiara.
It's been many years since I've danced like that.
It's been my greatest joy watching you grow day after day since becoming an idol.
It's been one year since Ichigo left Starlight Academy.
It's been on our minds as well.
It's been over ten years since we last saw the Starlight Tiara.
It's been quite a few years since the last time you called me that.
It's been so long.
It's been so long, but it's like you were never gone!
It's been so long since I've felt like this.
It's been so long since I've had Mama's kinpira veggies, after all.
It's been so long since I've seen WM I can't help it!
It's been so long since we stood on stage together!
It's been so many years since I've danced like that.
It's been such a long time since you've been home.
It's been that way since yesterday.
It's been three whole days since my roommate Sumire Gelato-chan vanished!
It's been too long.
It's been too long! How've you been?
It's been too long since I last came.
It's been two whole years already...
It's been way too long!
It's begun.
It's best to send her off with smiles.
It's better if you call it quits.
it's beyond special.
It's bigger than anything we've ever done before!
It's bigger than big!
It's bright again today.
It's brimming with Christmas!

It's called Dancing Diva!
It's called Love Queen.
- It's called super model super-training.
It's called the "Go go! Aoi Project!" "Go go! Aoi Project!"?
It's calming yet glamorous.
It scares me.
It's certainly close to the TKY station.
It's certainly good, but whether it has wide appeal or not...
It's certainly not easy.
It's certainly possible that people will let that pass if they know that you're new.
It's certainly true that Hoshimiya can't match your quality right now.
It's chocolate.
It's Christmas.
It's cold!
It's come at last...
It's coming from inside. I wonder if Mizuki-san's partner is here too!
It's coming from the second floor.
It's coming right at us!
It's coming this way!
It's coming up.
It's common knowledge that thinking about things you like will cause your eyes to light up.
It's complete!
It's completely different from Starlight!
It's completely different from Starlight Academy!
It's considered the biggest mystery in the idol world.
It's crazy.
It's crazy good, yeah!
It screams "Ice Flower of the Stage".
It's cute!

It's definitely gonna catch fire soon.
It's definitely not bad...
It's definitely possible.
It's definitely the place I received that horrible training...
It's definitely true that Mister S is digging up some sort of scandal.
It's delectable!
It's delicious!
It's delicious.
It's delicious, and so nostalgic.
It's delicious! Really!
It's delicious. You brought out the intricacies of the potato's flavor.
It's different from when we perform in a huge stadium.
It's different, isn't it?
It's difficult to say that Oozora Akari gave a skilled performance...
It's distinctive so I think it'd be fine, and if you think it's too stiff then you can shorten it.
It's Double M!
It's Double M's victory!
It's Dreamy Lake!
It's easy for people to make jabs at, too.
It's easy once you get the hang of it.
It's easy to write, but full of personality.
It's educational.
It seemed to me like they were a bit sad you quick so quickly.

It seems that Hoshimiya and Kiriya are here today for a rehearsal.
It seems that Oozora Akari-chan is being taken off to Aikatsu Boot Camp!
It seems that's not yet set in stone.
It seems that the Starlight Queen Cup has been officially announced.
It seems that they may have to cancel the new Premium dress announcement.
It seems that we won't have to wait long for Sumire-chan and Rin-chan's true debut.
It seems that your Starmiya special chocolate did the trick.
It seems there's not a single person who doesn't know you by your nickname Risappe.
It seems they mistook me for a real cop.
It seems they want to ask what kind of Queen you want to be.
It seems to focus on that glimmer of cuteness found behind a veil of maturity.
It seems you gave Noelle all sorts of advice when she confided her desire to be an idol to you.
It seems you've discovered my little present.
It's electrifying.
It's Elizabeth III's milk.
It's embarrassing...
It's embarrassing to be called Risappe in front of strangers.
It's enormous.
Its entire body is covered in scraggly fur, and it stands at twice the height of a human adult.
It seriously set my heart aflutter!
It serves as the proof of being a true Starlight student.
It's especially delicious if you eat it while surrounded by the scent of salt.
It's even better when Mizuki-chan's the one eating them.
It's even Christmas.
It's Evening Idol Time on Thursday!
It's Evening Idol Time Thursday!
It's even Sunday, so just relax.

It's exactly how I'd imagine a swordswoman who protects her princess looks like.
It's exactly like Ran says!
It's exactly like the idol world as a whole.
It's exactly the same as what he told us.
It's exactly what we wanted!
It's exciting!
It's exciting thinking about who'll give chocolate to who.
It's exciting thinking about who'll give chocolate to whom.
It's fiery, spicy, and hot.
It's filled with all of our fans' emotions.

It's nice to make an entire audience smile like blossoming flowers at once, but it's just as important to do it for each individual customer.
It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kurosawa Rin.
It's nice to see my rice scoop skills haven't started to rust yet.

It's no help.
It's no joke.
It's no lie!
It's Nono-chan and Risa-chan!
It's no prob.
It's no problem.
It's no problem. If possible, could you show me Dreamy Crown's new Premium dress too?
It's no problem. I should be thanking you for making time to see me.
It's no problem, we've got a lot of leeway in our schedule this time.
It's no prob, right?
It's no simple matter to bring a tour to fruition.
It's no surprise we're all nervous considering who our opponent is.
It's no surprise you didn't hear about them while in America.
It's not!
It's not...
It's not a big deal or anything.
It's not about whether you win or lose. You just want to make it the ultimate stage.
It's not a joke!
It's not any different from what I'm trying to achieve as an idol.
It's not a problem. A busy idol is a happy idol.
It's not a problem of skill.
It's not a problem since it was under three seconds.
It's not as easy as you think.
It's not as if I'm telling you to teach them history or math.
It's not as if I want you to teach them subjects like history or math.
It's not as simple as runway walking or dancing.
It's not a Starlight Christmas party without a tree!
It's not as though I can simply do so without...
It's not as though I'm not looking forward to hearing this.
It's not enough.

It's not even a question if you're entering too, right Kitaouji-senpai?
It's not even your birthday, and you're getting so many presents.
It's not every day a commercial offer comes, and even rarer that you do it solo.
It's not every day I see you all strung up like this.
It's not every day that you can get a chance like this.
It's not every day we can see each other working alone.
It's not every day we have an emergency assembly.
It's not every day you get a chance like this.
It's not exactly a problem...

It's not just the food we like.
It's not just their style.
It's not just the memories we have now.
It's not just to move the story along!
It's not like I became suddenly amazing at dance or anything, - It's time to announce the two idols who will adorn the cover of this year's new student directory.
It's not like I can just break through the ceiling to get in here.
It's not like I didn't appreciate it...
It's not like I don't understand, though.
It's not like I'm actually talking to them, but I feel like our feelings can be communicated.
It's not like I'm suddenly an amazing dancer now or anything, but I think I learned how to convey some of the fun I'm having.
It's not like it'll happen just from doing the same thing as Mizuki-san.
It's not like it's a bad thing...
It's not like I was expecting to become the Starlight Queen or anything, but I need to put in more.
It's not like I won't not agree to that.
It's not like I won't not celebrate for you!
It's not like there's no chance of Mizuki making it.
It's not like this is anything new for us.
It's not like us to let a chance like this slip by.
It's not like we're immune either...
It's not like we've never talked to Headmistress Orihime before.
It's not like you can always see yourself.
It's not like you're doing this for me, right?
It's not like you're not more amazing by being able to entertain everyone even without having a character.
It's not like you to make a mistake.
It's not "MoTru".
It's not "musket". They're mascots.
It's not my acting.

It's not that Hoshimiya can't move, it's that we have no idea where she'll move!

It's not that unexpected from her.
It's not the language of vampired either.
It's not the language of vampires either.
It's not the most important, but the Ranking is a good way of measuring popularity.
It's not the speed that matters, but the taste.
It's not the way an idol should speak.
- It's not though I can simply do so without— - It's not as if I can simply laugh without...
It's not walking the same path that makes you a team.
It's not whether she fits!
It's not your fault!
It's no use, there are too many!
It's now August, the height of summer!
It's no wonder she can see that.
It's no wonder she can see that, both of us are wearing name tags.
It's no wonder you're so needed.
It's now the day before our big concert.

It's too bad, but I think it would be safer to try to meet with the designer some other time.

It's to show that whoever wears it is a student at Starlight.

It's Toudou Yurika-chan.
It's tough right off the bat.
It's towering!
It's tragic, really.

It's Tristar's Cyan Trio Coord.
It's true!
It's true.
It's true, after all.
It's true! Right?
It's true that Alice is really different from the image Shion's built for herself.

It's true that individuality is important.
It's true that it might make the fans happy.
It's true that I want customers, but not so much that I would resort to dirty tricks.
It's true that might happen.
It's true that my dream might seem unachievable, but when I see Mizuki, who's the same age as me, running headlong towards her own titanic dream, I feel like I can't afford to give up!
It's true that Oozora's dress was at one point complete, but no more.
It's true that our paths will cross that day.

It's true that you won't be the one standing beside me when I take the stage again.
It's truly been too long since WM last took the stage.
It's truly gorgeous.

It's two birds with one stone!

It's up on the internet.
It's up to you, Arisugawa.
It's up to you three to handle this press conference.
It's up to you to choose which character you'll try out for.
It's up to you whether you want to participate.
It's Urashima Tarou and Otohime-sama!
It sure did.
It sure did. It almost feels like time flows differently here than in Hokkaido.
It sure does.
It sure does...
It sure has been a while.
It sure is!

It sure was cool.
It sure would be nice to wear Dreamy Crown's new Premium dress for my live.
It's us! We're on TV!
It's Valentine chocolate.
It's very delicious though.
It's very Loli Gothic, and is perfect for the stage of the Rosen Queen.
It's very Loli Gothic, and it's perfect for a performance as the Rosen Queen.
It's very Showa.
It's very similar to the taste of my homeland.
It's "Wake up my music".
It's "Wake up my music!" Now that's a nostalgic song.
It's warm...
It's warm and good for your throat.
It's way better to reveal information about yourself little by little.
It's way different from Swing Rock.
It's well made.
It's wet.
It's what I had!
It's what I've been focused on.
It's what Shion-chan said during lunch.
It's what they call the artist who gives the final performance of the festival on the main stage.
It's what you always say: "I'm fine. Even if I'm not, I'll make it so." Correct.
It's when all's said and done, whether you're left with any regrets or not, I think.
It's when the idols say "Everyone having fun?" and the audience goes "Yeah!" That back and forth between performers and the people watching is what we name "call and response".
It's when you combine the parfait and the cheesecake that you get something mysterious, interesting...
It's when you combine the wildly different parfait and cheesecake that you get something mysterious, interesting...
It's when you get a less-than-stellar fortune and think of ways to turn it into something positive.
It's whether you can or can't.
It's why I want to climb the stairway to idolhood.
It's wonderful!
It's wonderful.
It's wonderful for the skin and will warm you through to your bones.
It's wonderful! It's absolutely brilliant!
It's wonderful! Thank you so much!
It's wonderful that you'll be having a concert there.
It's wonderful to be able to bloom the flowers of an entire audience's smiles.
It's written all over your face.
It's written on your face.
It's yet another anniversary for you to remember!
It's you girls!
It's your chance to become the face of this popular drink!
It's your chance to compete with the Academy's top idol, the Starlight Queen.
It's your last chance to relax before the Cup.
It's your punishment for misspeaking.
It's yours now.
It's your turn.
It's your turn now, Akari.
It's your turn to compete to be the Queen, so I wanted to cheer you on.
It's your turn to see a new world with one of my dresses.
It's your very first commercial, after all!
It's your very first commercial, you know!
It's yummy!
It's yummy, you know.
It's Yurika-sama!
It takes a lot of talent to bring out someone's appeal like that.
It takes a massive change to make that kind of decision and come all the way out here.
It takes an amazing amount of care just to get it to bloom, plus...
It takes its inspiration from Alice's tea party.
It takes longer, but if you steep the tea in cold water rather than hot, I just got a fresh spring batch of Darjeeling in you can use. Its fragrance is to die for.
It takes longer, but if you steep the tea in water that's cold rather than hot, you can easily draw out delicious and non-astringent flavors.
It tastes amazing!
It tastes better than it looks.
It tastes completely different from normal rice!
It tastes great!
Ittekimasu I'm off now!
Ittekimasu Sunshine, sorry I made you wait, let's have fun today!
It tingles...
It took all of my courage.
It took all of my courage to convey my desire to enter Starlight Academy to my brother.
It took me a while before I got used to being on talk shows.
- It took more than a day.
It took no time at all before everyone started helping Kokone-chan out.
It took two whole hours to walk back though...
It totally matches the landscape.
It tries to capture the image of a mischievous little devil.
It truly could not have been written by anyone else. It even goes beyond human understanding.
It truly was a miracle that Mizuki-sama was able to win in her very first year.
It turned a switch somewhere inside me.
It turned out that the self-assured Yurika-sama was actually this cute, and that she actually loved garlic, which vampires are supposed to hate.
It turned out that the strong-willed Yurika-sama was actually this cute, but the gap between her character and herself was really attractive, so she gained a lot of fans.
It turned towards us!
It turns out I can't go to the fashion show.
I turned my mic into a scoop.
I turned my scoop into a mic and became an idol.
It used to be alright for idols to get a light tan for health reasons, And there's only one door, too.
It used to be here a long time ago, but it was damaged in a typhoon and had to be cut down.
It used to be okay for idols to get a light tan for health reasons, but the times have changed.
It was!
It was?
It was.
It was a big question which Futuring Girl dresses should be used for the music video.
It was a big question which Futuring Girl should be used for the music video.
It was a big scandal, but the gap between her character and her true self was really attractive, so she gained a lot of fans.
It was a bit spicy!
It was a blast getting to sing with you again.
It was about half a year ago...
It was about the same as if I opened a seaweed bento only to find curry inside!
It was a box with cute packaging just about the size of a card.
It was absolutely worth waking up early for the first time in six hundred years!
It was a cold winter day.
It was a cold winter's day.
It was actually my idea.
- It was a cute box just about the size of a card.
It was a fantastic performance befitting the favorites to take the Unit Cup.
It was a far-reaching dream of mine to become an idol.
It was a fateful encounter!
It was after seeing her that I decided to become an idol...
It was a fun conversation.
It was a good choice to wear my Ruby Blossom coord.
It was a good decision to personalize them like we do our coords.
It was a good fashion show.
It was a good idea to come out under the moonlit sky to listen to "Moonlight Destiny".
It was a good luck charm for both of us at the time.
It was a great idea to pay them a visit.
It was a huge shock when Kayoko-san refused to let me have a Premium dress three years ago.
It was a little hard to ask.
It was all her.
It was all my fault.
It was all so she could focus better.
It was all thanks to you two that I was able to make it through the interview.
It was a lovely story!
It was always my dream to create an idol like that.
It was a memorable summer for me as well.
It was a mightily fine coincidence.
It was a much happier feeling than what you get by looking up at the bright sky.
It was a perfect unit name for them.
It was a performance deserving of the word perfect.
It was apparently the director's wish to create an Alice that has never been seen before.
It was a rainbow that was thiiis big!
It was a really cool and trendy video, Aoi.
It was a really impactful meeting.
It was a really wonderful story.
It was a real pain getting her to wait ten minutes.
It was a real pain waiting these last ten minutes.
It was as if I donned rose petals made from hot-blooded passion itself.
It was as if she kept being reborn.
It was as original and delicious as a California roll.
It was a splendid choice for the wedding.
It was as though what I donned were rose petals made from hot-blooded passion itself.
It was a stunning take on Move on now that only you could've given us.
It was, at least to me.
It was a total blast to finally get back together with Aoi and Ran for a group concert!
It was a tour we cobbled together only with everyone's help, but I'm so happy we saw it through.
It was a treat I could look forward to when I got sick.
It was at the Junior Dancing Audition in Tokyo.
It was a variety show you could only see once a year.
It was awesome!
It was a wonderful performance.
It was a wonderful success.
It was back during the concert for our annual harvest festival, right after we finished our song together.
It was back in fifth grade.
It was back then...
It was back when I was a fashion magazine model in elementary school.
It was back when I was a magazine fashion model in elementary school.
It was back when I was in fourth grade...
It was back when I was still enrolled in Starlight Academy.
It was because it's important.
It was because of Kaede-chan, and Headmistress Orihime, and also...
It was because of Mizuki-chan's influence.
It was because you wanted me to make my own decisions about becoming an idol, right?
It was because you were so dazzling I couldn't take my eyes off you.
It was but an unfulfillable fantasy.
It was carefully made to fulfill the nutritional needs of a well-balanced meal.
It was certainly a surprise when Mizuki-san told us.
It was certainly good fortune that led such an incident to them. However, beyond a doubt, it was Skips that shined the brightest during today's Unit Cup.
It was Christmas.
It was completed not moments ago.
It was completely different from the stiff performing arts that I did.
It was completely worth it!
It was created to fit Mizuki-chan—a brand for Mizuki-chan alone.
It was created to fit Mizuki-chan— A brand for Mizuki-chan alone.
It was delicious!
It was delivered here earlier, but we can't find it anywhere.
It was done in your image.
It was everyone else... huh?
It was full of unexpected happenings.
It was fun!
It was fun.
It was fun for us too.
It was fun hearing about your travels.
It was fun hearing about your trip.
It was fun matching our movements to the music.
It was Futuring Girl that developed the technique of using jewel beetle wings as clothing material.
It was great.
It was great! My heart was pounding the whole way through.
It was great seeing all the fans' smiles at all the stadiums.
It was hard for Mama to take care of it.
It was here after all.
It was Ichigo-chan who made that girl smile.
It was impossible for a beginner such as myself.
It was impossible for me right now.
It was incredible!
It was incredibly difficult, and the coach I met there was Sergeant Pepper.
It was in middle school when I started wanted to make some myself.
It was in middle school when I started wanted to make them myself.
It was in my first role as the protagonist of a passionate drama.
It was in that letter.
It was irreplaceable!
It was Johnny-sensei's idea.
It was just a story.
It was just by chance that we managed to catch it earlier.
It was just so fun!
- It was just the two of us in the beginning.
It was King from MoTru!
It was like a bad dream! Truly a nightmare.
It was like a dried squid, where the more you chew on it, the flavor comes out!
It was like you were training for a sport.
It was long ago.
It was Mimi-san the Bohemian who inspired me to become a designer in the first place, after all.
It was Miya's choice to keep her secrets hidden.
It was Miya's choice to keep her secrets well hidden.
It was Mizuki-san's idea.
It was my duty to inherit it.
It was my duty to inherit those bonds.
It was my fans who first said that this character was interesting and decided to support me.
It was my favorite part...
It was my first time designing a cake, but I enjoyed the process very much.
It was my pleasure.
It was no calculation that brought me and Luminas together, but a miracle!
It was no problem.
It was nothing at all. I threw it together for the sake of performing together on Christmas.
It was nothing. Here, a package for you.
It wasn't a big deal.
It wasn't any different from her usual Demon Coach self.
It wasn't because of me.
It wasn't calculation that brought me and Luminas together, but a miracle!
It wasn't easy.
It wasn't English?
It wasn't exactly what we had planned, but oh well.
It wasn't from the time we decided about this audition.
It wasn't me, it was my mom's idea.
It wasn't really all that big of an idea.
It wasn't that long ago that we were joining hands and saying "let's do our best"...
It wasn't too long ago that I was in the seats, looking up at Mizuki-chan as she shined brightly.
It was of Masquerade's first concert.
It was one of my favorites in elementary school.
It was only a few seconds, If you way so it can't be wrong.
It was only after Akari-chan took her weather forecaster audition that I decided to just go for it.
It was only because of our encounter that we've come this far.
- It was only because of soil that we met.
It was only because of your help that we could come this far.
It was only because you were there for me.
It was only recently that I felt confident enough in my acting ability to take Starlight's transfer exam.
- It was only recently that I felt confident enough my acting ability - It's only recently that I felt confident in my acting ability And took Starlight's transfer exam.
It was original and delicious just like a California roll.
It was originally a foreign word to describe paintings and engravings of gods and goddesses.
It was originally a word to describe paintings and engravings of gods and goddesses.
It was our pleasure!
It was painful.
It was part of my desire to experience every type of soil!
It was perfect!
It was perhaps in bad taste to use them in such a way.
It was plain to see when we walked around the school today.
It was pretty silly.
It was probably just put on edge by everyone here raising a fuss.
It was quite a while back, but I've also done modeling for boy's clothing.
It was really big when we were in elementary school.
It was really cool!
It was really determined to get her off.
It was really fun!
It was really good.
It was really intense!
It was really interesting listening to all that.
It was really lame, right?
It was really worth it.
It was right around that time that Hime got the offer to become the Academy's headmistress.
It was right around the time I got an offer to become this school's headmistress.
It was scary thinking about what would happen if she didn't like it.
It was scary thinking about what would happen if she rejected it.
It was scrumptious, ma'am.
It was seriously something special.
It was snowing, but I felt like I needed to sing no matter what.
It was so cute how all the people's bikes outside that store were sorted by color.
It was something special!
It was so much fun!
It was so much fun being on stage together.
It was so much fun doing that all together.
It was so much fun it felt like my heart would burst.

It was so much fun to listen to!
It was so painful...
It was so striking a concert that I still can't believe it.

It was thanks to you...
It was thanks to you that I was able to come this far.
It was the best feeling ever!
It was the best feeling in the world!
It was the elegant splendor of an idol like no other.
It was the first day of shooting, after all.
It was the first time I'd ever seen such an exciting dance!
It was the greatest hearing your very own Move on now.
It was the headmistress's idea for the new students to learn how the top idol does her job.
It was the headmistress's idea for you new students to learn how the top idol does her job.
- It was then that I realized that this is what I was looking for - ano toki ne kizuita no kore datte wakatta no And the world seemed to change before my eyes sekai ga umarekawaru kurai and the world seemed to change before my eyes sekai ga umarekawaru kurai
It was then that my acting bloomed and grew without bound.
It was then that my acting bloomed, and grew without bound.
It was the right call to leave the decision in your hands.
It was the right choice to leave the decision in your hands.
It was the same back with Miyabi-chan, but these send-offs are always leave you with a sad feeling.
It was the same for me!
It was the same for me.
It was the same for us.
It was the same for us, wasn't it?
It was the same when you showed us around yesterday.
It was the talent to feel exactly what I needed to do to become happy.
It was the very first song we learned as idols.
It was three years ago that I first learned of Vivid Kiss.
It was to star in the newcomers' concert held to welcome all the new students.
It was to star in the welcome concert to bring in all the new students.
It was tough, but I'm so glad I did it!
It was tough to make my own, but the enjoyment I felt more than made up for it.
It was unbelievably good!
It was unsettling.
It was very educational.
It was when I first considered becoming an idol.
It was when I was in the Arctic— I ran into a starving polar bear.
It was when I was watching stunning idols or crazy funny comedians.
It was wonderful!
It was worth remaking it so many times.
It was you.
It was your own strength that let your true self shine through.

Johnny-sensei is getting married to Headmistress Tiara?!
Johnny-sensei It's a NO!
Johnny-sensei once told me, "Become an idol who can laugh through the bitterness." "If you can do that, you can make everyone happy." I get it.
Johnny-sensei, please let us hold the concert!
Johnny-sensei, please tell us about Sonny-san!
Johnny-sensei really is more amazing than we gave him credit for.
Johnny-sensei's?
Johnny-sensei said they all got together for a men's night out.
Johnny-sensei said those exact same words.
Johnny-sensei's dance is way too hard.
Johnny-sensei's entrances are always so unique.
Johnny-sensei's finally getting married today.
Johnny-sensei's going inside!
Johnny-sensei's really getting married?
Johnny-sensei's such an early bird.
Johnny-sensei, thank you for driving us.
Johnny-sensei told me about it.
Johnny-sensei told me that she's run up against a big wall.
Johnny-sensei told me this once: If I can do that, then I can make everyone happy.
Johnny-sensei was right when he said me and Akari-chan were different.
Johnny-sensei, we want your advice!
Johnny-sensei, what's happening?
Johnny-sensei, what was it you wanted to tell us?
Johnny-sensei, you must know who it is!
Johnny-sensei, you're amazing!
Johnny's hidden past!
Johnny's not your real name?
Johnny's path is one of raising idols and teaching them to dance.
Johnny, we've walked the same road since we began.
Joining her is Shibuki Ran-san, and last but not least is Kiriya Aoi-san!
Journalist?
Journeys are about your companions.

Juri-chan and Risa-chan were absolutely radiant.
Juri-chan, aren't you chilly?
Juri-chan, aren't you cold?
Juri-chan, congratulations!
Juri-chan, congratulations on winning the first day of the Queen Cup!
Juri-chan, forgive me for my absence.
Juri-chan, go for it!
Juri-chan, Hinaki-chan?
Juri-chan! Hinaki-chan! It's almost time for the backstage report!
Juri-chan, hypothetically speaking...
Juri-chan, I want to act alongside you!
Juri-chan, Juri-chan!
Juri-chan, let's act together!
Juri-chan, let's go draw our fortunes!
Juri-chan, let's have a great year!
Juri-chan! Madoka-chan too!
Juri-chan! Rin-chan! Madoka-chan!
Juri-chan's acting blew me away.
Juri-chan's coming out next!
Juri-chan's so hot!
Juri-chan, thanks for finding the fan!
Juri-chan, thanks for finding us a fan!
Juri-chan, want to practice Aikatsu Sensei lines?
Juri-chan, watch what you say!
Juri-chan, what did you get?
Juri-chan, which do you want?
Juri-chan, which side do you want?
Juri-chan, would you like to make one for me?
Juri-chan, you always amaze me.
Juri-chan! You can come to my house if you want!
Juri-chan, you have a fashion show tomorrow, right?
Juri-chan, your acting is making waves all over Kirakiratter!
Juri-chan! You really are hot!
Juri-chan, you're really devoting yourself to your partner search.
Juri-chan! Your ride is here!
Juri, do you really want to stop working?
Juri, I love how you and Shizuka-chan are polar opposites.
Juri, isn't it about time?
Juri's acting felt perfectly natural.
Juri-san, it's time.
Juri's been running all over the place looking for a partner to start her own unit with.
Juri's changed so much.
Juri-senpai and I have a magazine interview, a promo for our drama, and recording a radio show.
Juri-senpai and I have a magazine interview, a promo for our drama, and recording for a radio show.
Juri-senpai, don't go overboard!
Juri-senpai, it's in your capable hands.
Juri-senpai, you've caught her phony Kansai-speak.
Juri's gotta use the Spanish word for house.
Juri's running all over the place looking for a partner to start her own unit.
Jurius, allow me to assist you.
Jurius! Headmistress!
Jurius! Thank you!
Juri wants to make a unit like that, right?
Juri, welcome to Starlight Academy.
Juri? What are you doing just standing over there?
Juri, what brought you back to this world?
Juri, what made you come back?
Juri? Why are you just standing over there?
Juri, you mom's here.
- Juri, you're working through New Year's?
Juri, your mom's here.
Juri, you've changed.
Just 100 grams?
Just a bit.
Just a bit earlier. And I'm home.
Just a bit earlier. I'm home!
Just a bit faster than before.
Just a bit more.
Just a bit more than before.
Just a bit of celebration.
Just a bit, thank you.
Just about.
Just a couple, okay?
Just a little longer.
Just a little more...
Just a little while ago, I was looking up at Mizuki-chan as she shined brightly from the seats down there...
Just a minute there! We want to see how you girls make New Year's supper back at home.
Just a minute there! You're supposed to show us how you make New Year's supper back at home.
Just a moment!
Just a moment.
Just answer what fires up your desire to change on this tour.
Just a parfait?
Just a sec. Here you go.
Just a second!
Just a second.
Just a second, I hope you two haven't read the script in advance.
Just a sec, there's one right here.
Just as I thought, these clothes look great on you.
Just as I thought, these kind of clothes look great on you.
Just as one year ago to this date, you and your peers stepped forth to follow in our footsteps, those girls have set their sights on you.
JUST AS PLANNED As the headliner, I'm going to give all I have to max out the volume in the audience's hearts!
Just as the countless stars adorn the night sky, endless dazzling idols cast their light upon the Aikatsu stage.
Just as there are no rules in trying to find that perfect person to marry, there aren't any rules in picking your idol partner either!
Just as there are no rules to finding that perfect person to marry, there aren't any rules to picking your idol partner!
Just as vampires are to Transylvania...
Just as watching Hoshimiya-senpai set my heart aflutter.
Just as you've always brought happiness to those around you, continue those efforts here.
Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Just a while Now presenting today's main dish.
Just a year ago, I couldn't have imagined things would turn out this way.
Just a year ago, I wouldn't have imagined things would be like this.
Just be careful.
Just be careful not to fall over again.
Just be careful with how you speak and you'll be fine!
Just because I got these two doesn't guarantee that I'll get this next one too.
Just because it's April Fools doesn't mean you can get so high and mighty.
Just because of that face of yours.
Just because of that reputation of yours.
Just because we Aikatsu together doesn't mean we can all advance at the same pace.
Just because we're their senpai doesn't mean we have to do anything special.
Just because we're together doesn't not make me not unhappy.
Just because you...
Just because you're wearing a Constellation Dress doesn't mean you'll be able to do the appeal.
Just being cute isn't enough Just being cute isn't enough kawaii ja tarinai no wagamama ja nakya ne wagamama ja nakya ne You need to be greedy too You need to be greedy too wagamama ja nakya ne motto kirei ni natte motto kirei ni natte I'll increase my appeal
Just be sure not to hold Yurika-sama back.
Just between us, I've heard people say that he's the headmistress's younger brother.
Just between us, there is a single thing I cannot obtain despite my perfection.
Just be yourself.
Just be yourself, Ichigo.
Just by being there?
Just call me Rin.
Just desserts?
Just doesn't change, does he?
Just do it.
Just don't expect me to listen.
Just don't forget to leave some for me.
Just do what you always do.
Just earlier, Mizuki-chan came to my dressing room to tell me to treat her juniors well.
Just enjoy yourself out there.
Just enough?
Just fine.
Just focus on your own work!
Just follow me.
Just for a moment. Like, a tenth of a second.
Just forget about it.
Just for today, alright?
Just for today, points will be added for each of the backstage reports.
Just from watching her, I get the feeling that she's always alone.
Just get to the point already.
Just give it your all.
Just go out and enjoy it like always.
Just go out and enjoy it like you always do.
Just got back from work?
Just having it gives me the motivation to go on.
Just hearing those words sends shivers down my spine.
Just hold on a moment.
Just how high a place are you even aiming for?
Just how high are you aiming?
Just how hot will her performance be?
Just how long will it continue?
Just how much does she like it?
Just how will they overcome this?
Justice!
Just ignore them.
Just imagining you in a princess dress is something special!
Just in case a ghost comes to haunt us, a ward against evil spirits.
Just in case, I read up on famous scandals and celebrity divorce announcements...
Just in time...
Just Jurius is fine.
Just keep going as hard as you can.
- Just keep it up while you're here.
Just kidding.
Just kidding! I'm looking forward to your show!
Just kids...
Just la-la-la and enjoy yourself out there.
Just leave it to me!
Just leave it to me.
Just leave it to me, Onee-chan!
Just leave it to us!
Just let it flow!
Just let it flow.
Just let it flow...
Just let it flow's a saying we've got back in Okinawa.
Just let Juri-chan eat!

Just like Johnny-sensei!
Just like Johnny-sensei told us, our ad libbing skills will be tested.

Just like you are today, Ran.
Just like you decided to become a weather forecaster, I think I'll try to be a model.
Just like you said, it does really feel like a world of toys and dolls.
Just like you said, it does really feels like a world of toys and dolls.

Just looking at them makes me want one!
Just make sure you don't oversleep.
Just maybe.
Just not one that dances together.
Just now...
Just one?
Just one look made ideas come spilling out of my head.
Just one more and that's it.
Just one more pose!
Just one more push.
Just one more push. We've already come this far, so try and keep it up a bit longer.
Just one more set to get through until you can hop on your plane.
Just one more stop on the Luminas tour!
Just one short year ago, her fitness level was so low she was shipped off to Aikatsu Boot Camp.
Just one short year ago, she was so out of shape that she was shipped off to Aikatsu Boot Camp.
Just one thing...
Just quiet down and listen to Hoshimiya's song.
Just recently successfully performed a Constellation Appeal in Spicy Ageha's Constellation Dress.
Just relax. I'll be with you, so don't worry.
Just remembering what Hoshimiya-senpai said to me...
Just remember that forecasting isn't all rainbows and sunshine.
Just say what's on your mind.
Just shut up about the soil!
Just sit tight and wait until the water boils.
Just stop, Daddy!
Just take a look at this!
Just take another step with all that you've got!
Just take it already.
Just talking to myself.
Just tasting it fills me with happiness.
Just that?!
Just the best!
Just the fact that you're behind it builds all sorts of hype.
Just the other day, Ran played the demon for us.
Just the thought of helping Hoshimiya-senpai is firing me up!
Just this once, if you're do then I'm do too.
Just to remind you, you barely did anything.
Just to warn you, my lessons will be extremely hard.
Just trade places!
Just treat me like you did before.
Just trust me that it'll be good!

Just watching her made my heart race!
Just watching him made me hold my breath.
Just watching Otome-chan makes me want to join them.
Just watch it.
Just watch me pass. I'll open the door to my future with my own two hands.
Just what?
Just what could that goal be?
Just what is it that Otome loves?
Just what was Mizuki-sama thinking?
Just what was that?
Just what will become of us?!
Just what you'd expect.
Just where will the final battle be held?
Just whisper it into my ear.

My grandma told me once.

My grandmother taught me to cook when I was little.
My hair was short back then, and people often mistook me for a guy.

My instructor pushed for me to do the exchange.

Nobody said you have to wear high heels.
Nobody's ever pulled one of those off, right?
Nobody's ever successfully done one yet, right?
Nobody's expecting you to win, so at least make it exciting.
Nobody's gonna buy songs that we write for ourselves!
Nobody was expecting this to come out of nowhere.

Of course, I want nothing more than for them to catch up to me.

- Of the future? Please tell us more about these appeals.
Of the next generation? Please tell us more about these appeals.
Of what their elders are capable of.
of working as Angely Sugar's top designer Amahane Asuka-san's assistant, plus, of course, the fact that they started up the new brand Dreamy Crown. According to our original research, we believe that the designer is quite young...? While full of mysteries, that just makes us more excited to see just what dresses will come!
Oh!
Oh?
Oh.
Oh...
Oh, about those.
Oh, a call from Raichi.
Oh! Actually, I've also seen Mizuki-san's concert on this stage before.
Oh, almost forgot.
Oh, almost forgot. There's a popular waffle shop that just opened up.
Oh, and I also heard that you'll be designing the audition dresses yourself.
Oh, and I heard that you're holding the final stage here at Starlight Academy!
[Oh, and in this one, Ran's holding the rice scoop.] - Ran used it as a good luck charm when she was trying to become the Muse of Spicy Ageha.
Oh, and I sent you the Spanish lyrics you asked for.
Oh, and I want to fill up their stomachs too.
Oh, and the same goes for you, too.
Oh, and this.
Oh, and what did you see?
Oh, and you're the new Pon Pon Crepe Girl.
Oh, a reply.
Oh, are you?
Oh, are you Hoshimiya Ichigo-chan?
Oh, a special cute autograph!
Oh, a text from Raichi.
Oh boy!
Oh boy, I can hardly wait now.
Oh, but I like actually cooking more than reading about it.
Oh, but I might not be thinking that much either!
Oh, but I was impressed that she pulled off a wink like I usually do.
Oh, but I was impressed that she pulled off my trademark wink so well.
Oh, but she can't get any now.
Oh, but she's kinda cute too...
Oh, but she told me about it the day before it aired.
Oh, but she won't get my email.
Oh, but when I saw you putting in every effort when you couldn't make your break no matter what you did it really made me admire you!
Oh, by first flush I mean from the earliest harvesting.
Oh! By our powers combined...
Oh, can I have that for a bit?
Oh, can I see that for a bit?
Oh! Can't tell you that!
Oh, check this out. The group lessons are all filled up, but there are still plenty of short one-on-ones open.
Oh, chocolate. Did we have free cooking today?
Oh, chocolate. Do we have cooking classes today?
Oh, come on...
Oh, did she really?
Oh, don't mind it.
Oh! Don't tease me like that, please!
Oh, don't worry about it.
Oh, don't worry about that. Aoi-neesan and I have an information network set up already.
Oh, don't you have to head off for a DanDiva event now?
Oh, excuse me!
Oh, fantastic!
Oh, fantasy's not a bad idea.
Oh, first flush means it's from the earliest harvest.
Oh, forgive me. I was just charmed.
Oh, forgive us.
Oh, from that singing group.
Oh, give up!
Oh god!
Oh god, Ichigo-chan probably thinks I'm a freak. What now...
Oh god, I didn't expect it to take this long...
Oh god, I'm so sorry!
Oh, good.
Oh, good night.
Oh gosh! Guppy's coming to our Bon dance!
Oh, great!
Ohh.
Oh, hang on.
Oh, hang on, I'll put her on.
Oh, Headmistress.
Oh, he does research in that area.
Oh, hello?
Oh, he's a researcher in that area.
Oh, hey. Just studying up a bit.
Oh, H-Hoshimiya-senpai! Good evening!
Oh, Hinaki-chan!
Oh, honeys. What's up?
Oh! Hoshimiya Ichigo's here!
Oh, how about this?
Oh how pathetically overadorned idol dresses are.
Oh, how unfortunate.
Oh, huh?
Oh, I almost forgot.
Oh, I almost forgot something important!
Oh, I almost forgot! This is actually your home.
Oh, I almost forgot! Your family runs this place.
Oh, Ichigo's friend.
Oh, Ichigo-tan!
Oh, I'd better arrange the broadcast.
Oh? Idols don't get breaks, Ran-sensei?
Oh, I doubt you people will make it.
Oh, if it isn't the headmistress.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, if you're dressed like that...
Oh, I get it now!
Oh, "I get off"!
Oh, I got a text.
Oh... I guess we're all thinking the same thing.
Oh, I have an idea!
Oh, I haven't seen it yet.
Oh, I haven't seen that yet.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Oh, I just remembered something Johnny-sensei said.
Oh, I just remembered what Johnny-sensei told us.
Oh, I know!
Oh, I know this place!
Oh, I know what you should put for your special talent!
Oh, I'll let you talk to Mom now.
Oh, I'm cheering for you too, Onee-chan.
Oh, I'm gonna go again.
Oh, I'm right by a crepe shop.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't eat sweets at night.
Oh, I need to duck out early today.
Oh, I need to water it before the sun sets today.
Oh, in that case...
Oh, in the top shelf...
Oh, I see!
Oh, I see.
Oh, isn't it almost time for DanDiva's gig today?
Oh, is she?
Oh, is that right?
Oh, I think I understand.
Oh, it is true that Hinaki-chan has been making TV appearances ever since she was a child.
Oh, it looks like there's an event going on.
Oh, it only shows the top twenty.
Oh, it's about time.
Oh, it's as if she can hear nothing.
Oh, it's from Raichi.
Oh, it's from the headmistress.
Oh, it's here.
Oh, it's just you, Ichigo-chan.
Oh, it's Moon-san.
Oh, it's PowaPuri!
Oh, it's Shion-chan.
Oh, it's starting!
Oh, it's that...
Oh, it's that girl.
Oh, it's you.
Oh, it was that small park down the street.
Oh! I've actually seen one of Mizuki-san's concerts here in this venue before.
- Oh... I've been so excited to see them go on that I've been starving all day.
Oh, I've got a good idea!
Oh, I've heard of her!
Oh, I've seen you! You're Oozorakko!
Oh, I want to help too!
Oh, I want to know that too.
Oh, I was just talking to Ichigo on the phone. Why the call?
Oh, I was thinking of asking for a delay.
Oh, I was thinking of asking them to postpone it.
Oh, jersey!
Oh, jersey! Such a lovely ring.
Oh, jersey! You ring so sweet!
Oh, Juri-chan.
Oh, just one more thing.
Oh, just relax.
Oh, just stick your bags wherever.
Oh, Kiriya.
Oh, like a decoration?
Oh, like an ornament?
Oh, look!
Oh! Looks like the first corner has taken quite a few competitors down!
Oh man...
Oh man, I don't know what I'd do if I met the other girls backstage.
Oh man! I don't think I can match them.
Oh man, I need to hurry!
Oh man, the Starlight Queen Cup!
Oh man, we'll only have enough time to get our feet wet at the hot springs.
Oh? Maybe I should get one myself.
Oh, mine too!
Oh, Mizuki.
Oh, Mizuki-san!
Oh my!
Oh my.
Oh, my bad.
Oh my ears and whiskers!
Oh! My! Fan!
Oh my god!
Oh my God!
Oh my god! Bad news!
Oh my god! It's a scandal!
Oh my god! No more power!
Oh my God! No more power!
Oh my honey god!
Oh my, I hope they enjoy the short time that they can remain friends.
Oh my, I'm trapped.
Oh my! I'm very sorry.
Oh, my mom is a fashion magazine editor.
Oh, my mom is an editor for a fashion magazine.
Oh my. My name is Kitaouji Sakura.
Oh my, neither side will budge an inch!
Oh my, oh my, oh my?
Oh my! Otome-sama, Shion-sama, look at the monitor!
Oh my, Ran-chan.
Oh, my sister.
Oh my, sorry.
Oh my, sounds fun!
Oh my, thank you!
Oh my, we'll have to welcome her.
Oh my, what scrumptious visitors we have today.
Oh my, why cute little visitors we have today.
Oh my, you actually learned how to make food! That's just like you, Shion-sama!
Oh my, you actually made food!
Oh, Nao-kun!
Oh no!
Oh no...
Oh, no.
Oh no! Did I mess up our meeting time?
Oh no! Did I miss our meeting time?
Oh no, I don't know what to say...
Oh no! I forgot to call Aoi!
Oh, no. I guess...
Oh no, I'm getting short on breath.
Oh no, I'm late!
Oh no! I still haven't eaten my strawberry rice cake pudding!
Oh no, it's almost time to go on!
Oh no, it's already time.
Oh no! It's a pinch!
Oh no, it's getting cold!
Oh, no, I was just wondering if your family ran Chataigne in Kobe.
Oh no! Kurebayashi Juri-san's bag has torn, resulting in a total of zero points!
Oh no, look at this article!
Oh no! My map...
Oh, Nonocchi-san and Risappe-san say they made it to the Plaza Building.
Oh no, oh no!
Oh no!" Right?
Oh no, she failed!
Oh no, she has a leaf stuck in her hair...
Oh no! She saw my adolescent indiscretions!
Oh no! Sorry, but I need to head to the shop.
Oh no, there's a leaf stuck there.
Oh, nothing.
Oh... nothing.
Oh, no! We have too much weight, so we're going to go down!
Oh no! We need to hurry, Ichigo!
Oh no, we're gonna be late!
Oh no! We're gonna be late!
Oh no, what if it decides to eat us next?
Oh, no! What if it decides to eat us next?
Oh, of course!
Oh, of course...
Oh? Of course!
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, okay!
Oh, okay.
Oh, Onee-chan?
Oh, one more thing.
Oh, our props!
Oh person of fate, my destiny prince?
Oh, please.
Oh, please! I don't take any pictures!
Oh? Please take good care of them.
Oh please, they're not being blinded or anything.
Oh, Raichi.
Oh, Ran.
Oh, Ran's holding the rice scoop in this one.
Oh, Ran! Welcome back.
Oh really?
Oh, really?
Oh, really...
Oh, really? I thought you were coming home so I bought a watermelon.
Oh, really? I wanted to keep running, though.
Oh right!
Oh, right!
Oh, right.
Oh right! Choreography lesson, point four!
Oh, right. Did you hear about that audition for new students?
Oh, right. Did you hear about that audition limited to new students?
Oh, right! Did you remember to pack bug spray?
Oh, right. Do you think Yotsuba-san's fans from the other day are watching this on TV?
Oh, right. Go enjoy yourself.
Oh, right! Having a leader is really important.
Oh right, Hinaki-chan's been on TV since she was a little girl.
Oh, right. How long are you home this time, Dad?
Oh, right. I can't just stand here starstruck!
Oh, right! I ran into him out of the blue during that summer festival.
Oh, right! I received some chocolate as a gift.
Oh, right! I remember people calling you that.
Oh, right! I saw him at a summer festival a little while back.
Oh, right! I think I have a rare shot from back then.
Oh right, I wanted to ask about those rare cards you gave Aoi.
- Oh right Juri, you have New Year's gig.
Oh right Juri, you have that New Year's gig.
Oh, right. Mikuru-san, even after you became an idol, you never stopped your florist work.
- Oh, right, Mikuru-san. Even after you became an idol, you never stopped your florist work.
Oh, right. Miyabi-chan, aren't you going to change over to a Starlight uniform?
Oh, right. Miyabi-chan, aren't you going to try wearing a Starlight uniform?
Oh right! There are some other girls I'd like to invite.
Oh right. This is the first time we've spoken like this.
Oh, right! To put it simply, a Heroine Appeal!
Oh right, watch Ran closely.
Oh, right! We will be holding a handshake event today.
Oh right, your family runs a bento shop.
Oh, Seira. And you're not alone.
Oh, she changed her hairstyle!
Oh, she got an invitation from Maya-san of Loli Gothic.
Oh, Sora-chan!
Oh, Sora's...
Oh, sorry.
Oh, sorry. Am I asking too many questions?
Oh, sorry then.
Oh, sorry. What is it?
Oh, sorry. You must be starving.
Oh, so Sumire's at a crossroads.
Oh, so Sumire's facing a tough choice.
Oh, so that's her.
Oh, so that's what you'd wear to a date?
Oh, so that's why not even Kaede-chan knew.
Oh, so that's why she couldn't even tell Kaede-chan.
Oh, so this is the place.
Oh, so this is where those rumors came from.
Oh! Sour and sweet!
Oh, so you have a concert.
Oh, so you're a fan of singing, Risappe-san?
Oh, so you're just nervous.
Oh, so you're nervous.
Oh, so you're saying that we need to love, right?
Oh, so you're that kinda girl, Sumire-chan?
Oh? So you went for Dolly Devil.
Oh, speaking of cake...
Oh, speak of the devil.
Oh, Starmiya!

Oh, sure.
Oh, sure. See you.
Oh! Take this!
Oh, thanks!
Oh, thanks.
Oh. Thanks.
Oh, thanks for waiting.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, that!
Oh, that girl!
Oh, that is a great idea!
Oh, that is strange.
Oh, that makes sense.
Oh, that one.
Oh, that one's...
Oh? That really raises the stakes to have a white Christmas, then.
Oh, that's a much faster pace than usual.
Oh, that scene? The one where you set aflame the freezing-cold Principal Samusugi the one who seemed to suck all the motivation from his students?
Oh, that scene? The one where you set aflame the freezing-cold Principal Samusugi who seemed to suck all the motivation from his students?
Oh, that's right!
Oh, that's right.
Oh, that's right. Have you told your folks back home that you won't be able to make it back for New Year's?
Oh, that's right. I almost forgot.
Oh, that's right! I ran into Nono-chan and Risa-chan on my way to work this morning.
Oh, that's right. Madoka-chan, you're Amahane-sensei's granddaughter.
Oh, that's the Mizuki-chan fanclub's homepage.
Oh, that's when boys give chocolate to girls instead of the other way around.
Oh, that was an accident.
Oh, that was the "Yurika-sama was bitten by mosquitos" incident.
Oh, that would explain it!
Oh? The Akari-honey who had so much trouble using a Special Appeal is going for a Heroine Appeal now?
Oh, the correspondent Hoshimiya Raichi has been chosen to be the judge.
Oh... the excitement from waiting to see them go on has left my stomach growling all day.
Oh? Then that really raises the stakes to have a white Christmas.
Oh, then this'll be your momentous first handshake event.
Oh, the one from TV! You're Oozorotter!
Oh, the ones Mama used to make for us?
Oh, the orca.
Oh, there are types of soil that hold heat exceptionally...
Oh, the reason I stopped by—I mean, intruded upon you was to ask if you would allow me to wear Dreamy Crown's Premium dress.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, there she is!
Oh, there was that one time!
Oh, there you are!
Oh, these are my parents.
Oh, the time!
Oh, the world is centered around Kokone.
Oh, they're this way!
Oh, this?
Oh, this line!
Oh! This must be the reason why Kokone-chan has been so busy.
Oh, this must be the secret to Dancing Diva's skills.
Oh, this must be the secret to Dancing Diva's success.
Oh, this person...
Oh, this teacher?
Oh, those are Suzukawa-sensei's trunks.
Oh! Today's lunch was delicious.
Oh, today you must have to do Oozora Weather.
Oh, um...
Oh, wait a minute... this is for you.
Oh, want me to call for him?
Oh, was that it? Well, no matter.
Oh, water?
Oh, welcome!

Or maybe I should go into fashion?
Or maybe not. But it's true that I felt lonely.
Or maybe we won't have any summer homework?
Or mustering up the courage to say "good morning" a little louder than usual.
Or perhaps... do you want Yurika-sama to suck your blood that badly?
Or perhaps it would be better to say sensational?
Or perhaps you'll take your chances and try to go home?
Or perhaps... you really do wish to have your blood sucked by this Yurika-sama?
Or perhaps... you really do wish to have Yurika-sama suck your blood?
Or so I'd like, but that might be a bit too much for me.
or so I'd like to say, but in reality we asked Loli Gothic's designer, Yumekouji Maya-sensei, to help us out.
Or so I'd like to say, but we don't have much time.
Or so I was supposed to be, but after seeing the top idol Kanzaki Mizuki-chan's concert and falling head over heels for her, I took the entrance exam for the idol preparation school, Starlight Academy, and ended up passing.
Or so Kiriya-senpai would say.
or something?
Or so we want to, but we can't find our dresses!
Or so you think, but really he'll revert into a kid.
Or that.
Or that my perfect collection of Idol Freak Daily is actually missing the leap year special from February 29th!
Or the daughter of a bento maker!
Or try a mature look with Spicy Ageha.

So here we are, but nobody ever figured out who this hot guest is supposed to be.
So her name's Akane-chan.
So he's as tough as the rumors say.

Thanks! Anyways...
Thanks a ton, Raichi-kun!
Thanks, but...
Thanks, but being careful just slows me down.
Thanks! But first I'll try it straight.
Thanks. But I also try to incorporate ideas that girls wouldn't think of.
Thanks, but I'd like it more if you ate it.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Thanks! Daisies are my favorite flowers.

Thank you, Yurika, Kaede.
Thanky thanky thanks!
Thass' right! I'm Doujima Nina, ya know!
Thass' right! I'm the weather lady, ya know!
That!
That?
That?!
That accessory did the trick.
That almost never happens.
That along with becoming high school idols, we'd be entrusted with such an important job right away.
That also means I need to do a Constellation Appeal.
That also means that we wouldn't not have to ask her the question really, really subtly.
That always cheered me up since it felt like something special.
That amount of radiance can't overcome the moon.
That answer is revealed by the most meticulous of calculations!
That appetite of yours must be the source of all your energy.
That area is always crowded with people.
That area is always extremely crowded, so it's easy to get lost.
- That aside, I do want to set a more proper goal.
That attempt ended in failure.
That aura of yours is overwhelming!
That bath felt really nice.
That became our dream without any of us realizing it.
That being the case...
That bench looks good for a backdrop.
That bench was one of our traps!
That brings back memories.
That bunny is quite skillfully folded.
That burger was so juicy and delicious...
- That by fusing two completely different stars together, you can achieve an even greater brilliance.
That cake's really nice.
That cat outfit looks great on you!
That cat's already out of the bag.
That certainly is a home party.
That certainly sounds like a lot of fun.
That climax was amazing.
That cold-hearted type of role suits Shion the best.
That concert was amazing and fantastic and woo!
That concludes all of our units for today.
That concludes our backstage report.
That concludes our spring congratulations and announcement.
That concludes our spring congratulatory and announcement message.
That concludes the four units of the first half.
That concludes the sorting contest!
That conveys gratitude towards those feelings.
That conveys my gratitude toward them.
That could work.
That dance worked up a sweat.
That day is forever burned into my memories.
That day, I was able to answer their expectations thanks to Mikuru.
That day's promise remains ever in this breast.
That day three years ago, I saw Hoshimiya-senpai for the first time and made the decision to become an idol.
That'd be really impressive.
That'd be something really special.
That decides the theme.
That decides what'll happen if Akari-chan wins!
That depends on Double M.
That depends on what Double M does.
That didn't take long.
That didn't take long to get around.
That didn't work.
That'd just break apart when we dance on it.
That'd make me happy too.
That does look good.
That does make sense considering how busy all of you are.
That doesn't get us anywhere.
That doesn't help!
That doesn't matter a bit.
That doesn't mean that our unit, Passion Jalapeno, is going to cool off any time soon.
That doesn't mean the same will hold true for us on stage.
That doesn't sound like Ichigo to me.
That doesn't sound much different from usual.
That doesn't tell us anything about what it looks like.
That does seem to suit you both.
That does sound nice!
That each of us were already walking down the paths to our own futures.
That Emblem Hair Accessory did her well.
That ends another fun day of work.
That ends today's forecast!
That ends today's recording.
That enough!
That even if we can't see them, somewhere, there are surely people who are enjoying our music as much as yours.
That event caused a huge boom of Ichigo fans.
That event was announced via KiraKiratter and television, was it not?
That every customer should be treated with care.
that exist deep in everyone suki to kirai wa dare mo ga motteiru kanjou Everyone sees the world in their own light like a spinning kaleidoscope sekai wa itsudatte juunin toiro mawaru mangekyou Everyone sees the world in their own light like a spinning kaleidoscope sekai wa itsudatte juunin toiro mawaru mangekyou
That experience will definitely come in handy.
That explains her absence.
That explains her applause...
That explains it.
That explains it. I'm glad it was nothing serious.
That explains it! I've heard all about Beautybeach Beat Academy.
That explains it! I've heard all about Beauty Beach Beat Academy.
That explains why none of them have come in since!
That explains why you hear about celebrities always going to Hawaii and stuff around the same time they're on TV.
That explains why you speak...
That explains why you've been practicing it ever since you decided to enter.
That expression became so familiar that I didn't even think of it as strange.
- That expression became so familiar that I didn't think of it as strange.
- That expression became so familiar to me that I didn't even recognize it as strange.
That failed.
That failed. Sumire-chan wasn't shocked in the slightest.
That fall was a bit too real, but now their laughs are as good as mine!
That famous chef will make us a special dish?
- That fashion sense is something you're born with.
That felt awesome, right Mizuki?
That felt great!
That few?
That first step felt unbearably heavy.
That gap is their best point.
That girl...
That girl had the same one at the handshake event.
That girl has also influenced several designers.
That girl is...
That girl is a linchpin.
That girl is always so much cuter That girl is always so much cuter guzutsuku sora ni kokoro mo kumoru guzutsuku sora ni kokoro mo kumoru My heart is cloudy like the London sky My heart is cloudy like the London sky kyou no yotei dou shiyou kyou no yotei dou shiyou
That girl... right! She's Otoshiro Seira!
That girl... right! She's Otoshiro Seira-chan!
That girl's amazing!
That girl's amazing.
- That girl's coordination was really nice.
That girl's from our class...
That girl's outfit is really well put together.
- That girl's outfit's really well put together.
That girl there is popular both as a designer and an idol.
That girl truly loves western-style clothes.
That girl was Ichigo.
That goes for all of us here.
That goes for both us and our fans.
That goes for me too. You two are always pulling me forwards.
That goes for me too. You two are always pulling me onwards.
That happened?
That happened for me too.
That has an idol-y ring to it!
That has nothing to do with how long you've been in the business.
That has nothing to do with it.
That headmistress is hiding something.
That helps me focus.
That here at Starlight Academy...
that he wouldn't approve of your music.
That... huh?
That hurt, you know.
That Ichigo sure knows how to do things.
That idea of Ichigo-chan's was super ok-ok-okay.
That I do!
That I might.
That I'm "interesting".
That I'm not Mizuki.
That I mustn't wear them halfheartedly.
That includes our encounters with each other, which inspired us to grow into who we are now.
That information is all useless, though.
That in itself will cause problems for the movie theater.
That in itself would cause problems for the movie theater.
That is...
That is a masterpiece, Otome-sama.
That is a pretty good way to describe Kiriya.
That is a unit.
That is correct. I will exert all efforts to live up to the reputation my predecessors have created.
That island... really is...
That is linked to your actions behind the scenes.
That is my greatest happiness.
That is my true happiness.
That is, of course, really important, but it's normal for people to be different.
That is precisely how Shibuki was able to become a goddess who could arouse her designer's creativity.
- That is precisely how Shibuki was able to become a goddess who could arouse her designer's imagination.
- That is precisely why Shibuki is a goddess able arouse her designer's imagination.
That is the idol, Amahane Madoka's resolve.
That is the question.
That is the Unit Cup.
That is the world of idols.
That is to say...
That is to say, a muse.
That is true.
That is true... what do we do, Ran?
That is unexpected.
That is, until their saviors suddenly make their appearance.
That is when your mettle will truly be tested.
That it does. And once the Aikatsu8 elections end, Hoshimiya's unit will be unveiling their plans for this event.
That it has! I'd like to take this chance and show off how much I've grown from the experience.
That it is.
That it is because of the strong bonds you share with another, that no matter how far apart you may be, your hearts will always be connected.
That I too shall one day become an idol!
That itself is an idol's Love You power!
That it was an incredible performance.
That it will be.
That it would.
that it would've been perfect if only all three of us were chosen for the Aikatsu8.
That I've had to leave my friends...
That I've once again turned my scoop into a mic.
That I've turned my mic into a scoop.
That I will!
That Johnny-sensei.
That just goes to show how Love You Soleil's concert was!
That just leaves us.
That just means I need to aim even higher to outrun you.
That just means that Kokone is still herself, even here at Starlight.
That just means we've all grown.
That Kanzaki Mizuki-san is really something, isn't she?
That kind of idol.
That kind of love fuels you.
That kind of partner.
That kind of stuff.
That last one's just Hoshimiya-senpai!
That laugh isn't my Aoi!
That leaves Ichigo in the Paw Print coord...
That leaves the rest of us free to focus on doing Aikatsu to become top idols!
That led to this inspiration!
That legendary drama's coming back!
That legendary event, the Starlight Queen Cup, is upon us!
That legendary unit is going to be revived at the Great Starlight School Festival!
That legendary unit is reforming at the Great Starlight School Festival!
That let our fans be able to come up and interact with each one of us by ourselves, which made them feel even closer to STAR☆ANIS, and in turn come to love us even more than before.
That let our fans come to and interact with each one of us by ourselves, which made them feel even closer to STAR☆ANIS, and in turn come to love us more.
- That letter became my treasure that supported me through thick and thin.
That level of dancing wouldn't even reach Double M's feet!
That line...
That'll be a huge help.
That'll definitely fire the crowd up more.
That'll do it for today's recording.
That'll end the filming too...
That'll make them unique.
That looked like a high-level appeal to me, but what will the board show?
That looked like a high-level appeal to me, but what will the results show?
That look in your eyes...
That look is perfect!
That looks delicious!
That looks good too!
That looks like it hurt.
That looks really fun!
That looks so exciting!
That looks so yummy...
That love becomes your strength.
That made me feel like I had to take my reporting up a level.
That made me really happy.
That made me so happy I decided to make a lot more people smile in the same way.
That made me so happy that I decided to make even more people smile in the same way.
That makes him the Starotter Queen.
That makes it Casa Juri!
That makes it more exciting.
That makes me feel all warm inside!
That makes me happy.
That makes me pretty happy!
That makes me sol!
That makes my obvious target the person she's in near daily contact with.
That makes no sense!
That makes our friendship eternal!
That makes perfect sense!
That makes sense!
That makes sense.
That makes sense. Did she say anything else?
That Mama of yours wants you to be as cute and cheerful as possible.
That may be so. At least it's a good way to lose.
That may be true.
That may be true, but...
That may be true, The Moon and a Soft-shelled Turtle but the reason those two are compared is that despite the fact that they're both round, they're completely different.
That may not not be the case here.
That means a lot.
That means a lot coming from you.
That means a lot, Noelle-chan!
That means a lot to me.
That means a lot to me. Even outside the dojo, I do my best to incorporate them at school and home.
That means a lot to me. I do my best to incorporate my training into matters outside the dojo.
That means a lot to me. S-So...
That means I'll just have to be mi!
That means it's just plain old dirt, then.
That means it's the tour of your dreams, right?
That means I won't go easy on you.
That means our senpai will be there!
That means so much to me!
That means stuff, stuff, and stuff some more!
That means that...
That means that even with his hectic schedule, he finds the time to watch other people's programs.
That means that the idol who will shine as this year's Starlight Queen is standing among you.
That means that the other half has to be the moment you shine together.
That means that you're a one-of-a-kind idol!
That means the audience's involvement plays a huge part in this.
That means the giant Ebipon is on its way to Ran while she's being interviewed?
That means the giant Ebipon is on its way to Ran while she's in the middle of her interview?
That means the three of us might end up the same one day!
That means we can't use the Aikatsu system either!
That means we need to hurry.
That means you're an idol too!
That means you're going to be an idol, Mado-chan.
That means you won't be able to train with us.
That might be a bit too crazy.
That might be a good idea.
That might be how I can put on cooler than usual performances with her.
That might be something special.
That might be stretching it.
That might be the biggest culture shock I've had yet.
- That might be the reason I started using research and calculations in my comedy.
- That might be the reason I took a calculative approach to comedy.
That might be the reason I took a sabermetric approach to comedy.
That might be true.
That might be true. Her mom's an actress.
That might be why I can pull off cooler-than-usual performances when I'm with her.
That might mean that Mizuki-san's partner is going to be the idol she created.
- That might mean that Mizuki-san's partner's going to be the idol she created.
- That might mean that the idol Mizuki-san created is going to be her partner.
That might work!
That movie is "Alice in Wonderland".
That much?
That much I can do.
That must be it.
That must be unimaginably hard to accomplish.
That must be why I can't be sure what words will reach her.
That must be why they can grow without limit.
That must be why they've soared so high.
That must be why you asked Mikuru-san to be your partner, right?
That must mean that the precious thing we forgot about is omelettes!
That must've been a real miracle.
That must've been because of how much she wanted to see you.
That must've been your power to pro-pro-produce!
That must've put you on the spot.
That Natsuki Mikuru has the ability to overcome any trial by her own strength.
That never crossed my mind.
That new appeal you did was called a Constellation Appeal, right?
That news is abuzz around the academy as well.
That nickname is so adorable!
That night, I saw Ichigo-chan giving her all to help a friend in need.
that nothing here will change doko demo kawari nai to oshiete ageta keredo doko demo kawari nai to oshiete ageta keredo but girls can't accept that answer but girls can't accept that answer onna no ko ni wa juuyou mitai onna no ko ni wa juuyou mitai However wonderful your presents may be
That obviously the ultra sexy Japan beauty!
That okay?
That one actually fell apart right before we finished it the first time.
That one day, the two of us would have to compete against each other.
That one ended in failure.
That one really looked like him!
That one's from Dreamy Crown.
That one's no good. Do it over.
That one's so pretty!
That openness must be why Dream Academy has made such a splash in so little time.
That other school is going to send us an idol too, right?
That performance was amazing!
"That person"?
That person is all you can think about, and you can't eat or drink anything.
That place might...
That pony is so cute!
- That precious letter helped me through so many things.
That public challenge was nuts!
That puts Ichigo in the Paw Print coord...
That reaction is exactly why I chose them.
That reaction makes you look like you're getting ready to be yelled at.
That really brings back memories.
That really brings back memories...
That really calms me down.
That really hurt, you know!
That really is a lot.
That really must be a huge dream for them all.
That really surprised me.
That reminds me...
That reminds me of something I once heard.
That reminds me of yesterday...
That reminds me! Yotsuba-san's limited-time donuts are out today.
That right. I have to put in enough effort for Aoi since she couldn't enter the audition.
That right. I was able to act in a small part as an extra, but...
That right then... it couldn't have been...
That rocker is a dream girl.
That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl I'm Kiriya Aoi.
That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl With ever burning passion, Idol Activities!
That's!
That's...
That's a beautiful way to lose.
That's a bit too subdued a name for Kitty.
- That's a bit too subdued of a name for a Neko-tan.
That's a bit unexpected.
That's absolute taste for you!
That's a completely different thing.
That's a cute name.
That's adorable!
That's a good choice.
That's a good idea.
That's a good idea to not forget any new ideas.
That's a good thing!
That's a good thing for idols.
That's a good thing! I'm sure your power comes from how long it took to make your big break.
That's a good way to look at it.
That's a great name, yeah!
That's a huge emergency!
That said...
That said, a strong electric front...
That said, I really just made the design, helped stir the batter, and put the finishing touches on the decorations.
That said, it's true that we barely had enough time to prepare.
That said, since we don't have much time I do have a recommendation.
That said, since we don't have much time, I do have a recommendation.
That said, we barely had enough time to prepare.
That's a key facet of communication: call and response.
That Sakurairo Kaden dress is perfect on you, Miyabi-chan!
- That Sakurairo Kaden dress is perfect on you, Miyabi-chan! - Fujiwara Miyabi-chan has such a unique aura. I'm totally a fan now!
That's a lie.
That's all, folks.
That's all, folks. Take care on your commute, and have a nice day!
That's all part of who Natsuki Mikuru is.
That's all! That's the last one!
That's all there is to it!
That's all well and good, but how was the boot camp?
That's all well and good, but they seem to be relaxing a bit too much.
That's all well and good, but what should we say to her?
That's all well and good, but what should we tell her?
That's all well and good, but why are the three of us sitting around eating donuts at this hour?
That's all work though, right?
That's all you need to know.
That's all you've been saying this whole time.
That's a long history... huh?
That's a long list!
That's a lot of pressure.
That's a lot of sweat.
That's a lot you got there.
That's a lot you've got there.
That's a lovely expression, Shinjou.
That's alright.
That's a magnificent tree!
That's a Mastery that you should understand very well by now.
That's a mature thing to say.
That's amazing!
That's amazing.
That's amazing, Aoi.
That's amazing, but her character...
That's amazing! Congrats, Hinaki-chan.
That's amazing, good job.
That's amazing. Good job!
That's amazing, Hinaki-chan!
That's amazing. I got lost in your playing.
That's amazing, Mizuki!
That's amazing, Ran. Even in disguise, your idol aura just oozes out.
That's amazing, Shion-sama!
That's amazing. So we can watch it from here?
That's amazing. What's it like?
That's an elegant way of putting it.
That's an exaggeration.
That's a nice expression.
That's an idol's Love You power!
That's a no!
That's another one of her good points.
That's a pretty good estimation of how Shion is.
That's a pretty weak reaction.
That's a pro for you.
That's a really difficult question.
That's a really wide range of activities.
That's a rock star for you.
That's a secret until it begins.
That's a silly question.
That's asking the impossible. I take as much time as I need to create my works.
That's a testament to Karen-san's skill as an actress.
That's a very real possibility.
That's a vital part of the theme.
That's a weather forecaster for you.
That's awesome!
That's awesome, Akari-chan!
That's awesome! Thank you!
That's a wonderful realization.
That's a wonderful story.
That's barely different.
That's because...
That's because I am.
That's because I convinced Sena Wing myself over the phone, yeah!
That's because I might be making the custom-made dress.
That's because it was my own mansion...
That's because Ran's favorite brand, Spicy Ageha, is holding a seasonal audition to determine their representative model.
That's because today's me is acting as Masquerade's choreographer.
That's bothering you?
That's called a tortilla.
That scandal's going to just blow over before you know it.
That scandal's going to just blow right over.
That scared me!
That's certainly a lot of pressure.
That's certainly important.
That's certainly true.
That's certainly you.
That's chemistry, Headmistress.
That's classified information.
That's clever.
That's correct.
That's correct, I have a venue reserved on that day.
That's correct. I will exert all efforts to live up to the reputation my predecessors have created.
That's correct. The highest rank SA appeal is unimaginably challenging to achieve.
That's crazy cutthroat!
That's Dandai's catchphrase, isn't it?
That's definitely an Ichigo answer.
That's DreAca!
That's Dream Academy!
That seems a bit...
That's Elizabeth III.
That's enough!
That's enough.
That's enough for me.
That's enough. Get a room, you two.
That's enough, I need to get back on my feet already.
That's enough. Let's just get to packing it all up.
- That's enough of games - jirasanaide - That's enough of games - jirasanaide - That's enough of games - jirasanaide Look only at me watashi dake mitsumete - Look only at me - watashi dake mitsumete - Look only at me - watashi dake mitsumete - And I'll give you
That's enough outta you!
That's enough! Warm-ups are now over.
That's everyone.
That's exactly it! If we could just find out the reason, we might be able to help Sakura-chan!
That's exactly it! If we could just find out why, we might be able to help Sakura-chan!
That's exactly right!
That's exactly right.
That's exactly what a leader's job is.
That's exactly what I just said.
That's exactly what I thought.
That's exactly why we usually avoid them.
That's exciting!
That's fantastic!
That's fine, but...
That's fine, but are you feeling better?
That's fine, but is your arm alright?
That's fine, I guess.
That's fine. There's a zooquarium that just opened.
That's fine with me. If you look at it another way, we're rookie senpai ourselves.
That's fine with me. Put another way, we're first-year senpai ourselves.
That's for you to think over.
That's freshness for you.
That's giant squid sushi!
That's gonna be mightily exciting!
That's gonna go down in Starlight's history books.
That's good!
That's good.
That's good. And you're not hurt?
That's good, but I guess it isn't all that easy to get one anyway.
That's good, but I guess it isn't all that easy to wear one.
That's good enough.
- That's good fortune.
That's good... huh? Where did it go?
That's got to be from watching Akari-chan.
That's got to come from watching Akari-chan.
That's great!
That's great.
That's great and all, but why are we in the air?
That's great and all, but why don't you go try that on?
That's great, Aoi!
That's great! He's sure to help us come up with a menu like nobody's ever seen.
That's great, Ichigo!
That's great! It's so us!
That's great. I wanted to celebrate with you in person.
That's great, keep going like that.
That's great, let's do it!
That's great! Let's help get them ready for the festival!
That's great! Let's help them get ready by the festival!
That's great, Mikuru-chan!
That's great, Rin-chan!
That's great, Risappe! You'll finally be able to meet Mizuki-san!
That's great, Risappe! You'll finally get to meet Mizuki-san!
That's great! Sunnys!
That's great too! It's so fresh!
That's great... yeah, I really like it!
That's hardly shorter.
That's harsh.
That she does.
That she gave me my dream!
That she has an amazing power.
That's her background. She calls herself the descendant of vampires, and got her big break because of her mysterious character.
That's herbal tea. I hoped it would help us calm our nerves.
That's herbal tea. I was hoping it would help us calm our nerves.
That's her character.
That's Hikami Sumire, who released the hit song Tutu Ballerina.
That's Hikami Sumire, who released the hit song, Tutu Ballerina.
That's Hikari. Minowa Hikari.
That's Hikari's style.
That's hilarious for reals!
That shining stage was forever embedded deep within mine eyes.
That's how daring I am!
That's how I live my life.
That's how I realized this had to be my battle song.
That's how it is.
That's how they know each other.
That's how you build up your own sense of fashion.
That's how you ended up inviting me here.
That's how your vampire character was born, right?
That's impossible!
That's impossible, you know...
That's incredible!
That's incredible, Madoka-chan!
That's interesting.
That's interesting. You said you met her at a dance audition in Tokyo?
That's it!
That's it?
That's it! Akari-chan, do you girls still have time?
That's it! Excuse me!
That's it for the rehearsal. Good work!
That's it for today's lesson.
That's it for today's meeting.
That's it for today's news!
That's it for today's shoot!
That's it! I'm in love with that kitty!
That's it! I'm in love with that Neko-tan!
- That's it! Just because she's leaving doesn't mean we have to say goodbye.
That's it! Just because she's leaving doesn't mean we have to say goodbye.
That's it! Just like that!
That's it, Madoka-chan!
That's it. That's the precious thing that we'd forgotten about.
- That's it! There's no need to part with a farewell.
That's it! This dress is so cute!
That's Juri-chan for you.
That's just a coincidence.
That's just a silly pun!
That's just how things are though, you know?
That's just like absolute pitch.
That's just like Ichigo.
That's just like Mizuki-chan! She's already model walking first thing in the morning.
That's just like Mizuki-chan! She's already walking like a model first thing in the morning.
That's just like you.
That's just like you, Akari-chan.
That's just like you, Ichigo.
That's just like you, Otome-chan!
That's just one of Akari-chan's charms.
That's just way too special!
That's just what you want to eat.
That's kinda cool, Mizuki.
That's lacking too much impact, yeah.
That slight air of mystery is exactly like you, Sumire-chan.
That slight blush is adorable too!
That's like, totally a rip of the coord on page 57 from this month's Fashion Mini.
That's lookin' good.
That's lovely!
That's lovely.
That's making me want to try even harder.
That's me!
That's me.
That's means we can't use the Aikatsu system either!
That's means you'll be able to apply too, Akari! You might even meet Ichigo-chan.
That's Megu-chan!
That's me. I'm going to be your mentor for a while. It's a good thing we met.
That smells nice.
That smile...
That's Mizuki-chan.
That's Mizuki for you.
That's Mizuki-san's new agency.
That's Mizuki-san's partner?
That's more like a gentle breeze.
That's more like it.
That's more like it, Ichigo.
That's more like it— nothing like a Japanese breakfast.
That's more like it—nothing like a Japanese breakfast.
That's my...
That's my aim. If we used these...
That's my Akari-chan.
That's my Aoi!
That's my aura.
That's my dream.
That's my family's helicopter.
That's my goal as an idol.
That's my Ichigo!
That's my Ichigo-tan!
That's my Mikuru.
That's my mission.
That's my proposal.
That's my way of being an idol.
That's my way of swordsmanship.
That's news to me.
That's New Year's Day.
That's nice to hear.
That's nice to hear! Go ahead and eat your fill.
That's Nina, ya know!
That's no good, Sakura-chan!
That's none of your business.
That's Nono-chan and Risa-chan.
That's no problem at all.
That's no surprise.
That's not...
That's not about me.
That's not a compliment!
That's not a figure becoming of an idol at all.
That's not all there is.
That's not exactly it...
That's not good.
That's not good enough.
That's nothing like an aphorism!
That's nothing to apologize for. I love it.
That's not how it works...
That's not important here...
That's not it...
That's not it. Don't you smell an idol around here?
That's not it, Ichigo-sama.
That's not it, it's just better for us to match. It isn't your fault.
That's not really a punishment.
That's not really a secret either.
That's not really a secret either...
That's not right.
That's not the case at all.
That's not the Hoshimiya Ichigo that I know.
That's not the only reason.
That's not the problem, Ichigo-sama.
That's not true.
That's not true at all! And besides, you're a lot nicer than you look.
That's not very idol-like.
That's not what he means by "the other side"...
That's not what I...
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I mean...
That's not what I mean! I'm talking about the yeti and polar bear stuff.
That's not what I was going for!
That's not what I was talking about.
That's not what she meant...
That's not what you should be saying.
That's not what you should be watching...
That's not why! I just got the urge to eat it myself.
That's obviously the ultra sexy Japan beauty!
That's okay, I was just so relieved that tears came out.
That so. Knock 'em dead!
That solves that mystery.
That's Onee-chan, right?
That's one of Osaka's specialties, kushi katsu, ya know!
That's one of the things Asuka-san taught me.
That's one reason, but I've also been invited to be in the OPQ Rock Fest.
That's one reason, but I've also been invited to be in the S.P.Q.Rock Fest.
That's one thing about Ichigo that never changes.
That's one way to look at it.
That song!
That song must mean a lot to you.
That's only because there's not much else I can do.
That's only if we manage to pass.
That sort of filthy activity isn't necessary for a being such as myself who has surpassed you lowly humans.
That sort of filthy activity is unnecessary for a being who has surpassed you lowly humans, such as myself.
That sort of stuff has nothing to do with wanting people to listen to my music.
That sound... could it be?
That sounds fun!
That sounds fun.
That sounds good!
That sounds good. I'll try talking about my own experiences too.
That sounds good to me.
That sounds great!
That sounds great.
That sounds hot!
That sounds impossible!
That sounds incredible!
That sounds interesting!
That sounds just like Akari-chan.
That sounds like a big downgrade in scale.
That sounds like a luxurious home party!
That sounds like an SOS.
That sounds like fun!
That sounds like he gave you the go-ahead!
That sounds like it'd be really fun.
That sounds like something out of a dream.
That sounds lovely! Let's have tea!
That sounds nice.
That sounds nice. It's like a vacation home.
That sounds plausible!
That sounds pretty good.
That sounds really hard.
That sounds right.
That sounds so cool.
That sounds so incredible!
That sounds wonderful.
That source being blood orange juice.
That's our goal!
That's our job as models.
That's our Juri-senpai!
That's our Kanzaki Mizuki.
That's our last promotion for today.
That's our Otome-chan!
That's our PowaPuri.
That's our Princess Two!
That's our third A rank appeal today.
That's our third A-rank appeal today.
That's our Yurika-tan.
That's part of my main dish!
That's part of what makes you great.
That's part of why PowaPuri's so popular.
That's part of why this house is so great.
That's perfect for Juri.
That's perfect! Idols are made of passion!
That's perfect! Time to put it to the test, Sumire-chan!
That's plenty insane!
That's plenty, Madoka-chan.
- That's positive fortune-telling.
That's positive reading.
That's pretty amazing.
That's pretty bold.
That's pretty good for someone so new.
That's pretty great for someone so new.
That's pretty intense.
That's pretty much how the meeting went.
That's pretty nice, and the color matches your eyes.
That's pretty poetic.
That's pretty rare.
That's pretty spot on.
That's probably true.
That's probably why. Adults and the elderly don't really know that much about idols.
That's proof that they're already perfect partners who are looking in the same direction.
That's quince honey tea.
That's quite alright, Juri-chan.
That's quite alright, Juri-chan. It must have been so painful for you.
That's quite the confidence.
That's quite the name...
That's quite the pace.
That's rare.
That's really admirable.
That's really amazing!
That's really fresh!
That's really interesting.
That's really rare for Ichigo...
That's really reassuring.
That's really worldwide!
That's reassuring to hear.
That's ridiculous! You need to stay in bed.
- That's right!
That's right!
That's right.
That's right...
That's right, Aikatsu girls.
That's right. Akari-chan has just passed her start line.
That's right. Akari-chan just passed her start line.
That's right. All good things come to an end.
That's right, all of you.
That's right. All the girls before me had such cute posters, too.
That's right. All we know about her is that she wears Vivid Kiss, a brand born in L.A. and designed by Kayoco.
That's right. Also, aren't my hands... cold?
That's right. And it's not just the food that'll make her smile...
That's right, and now the bar's been raised.
That's right, and now the hurdle's been raised.
That's right. And only very few of them will be accepted.
That's right. And the brand I like is Angely Sugar.
That's right. And this is the first job I want you to take on as high school students.
That's right! A raging schedule awaits!
That's right. Are you asking because my hands are cold?
That's right, because it'll be airing over 24 hours.
That's right, because it's your turn next.
That's right. Both Shibuki Ran and Kiriya Aoi have entered.
That's right! But I'm the type to tense up whenever I train alone.
That's right. But in all honesty, we're still together a lot more now than we have been.
That's right! But I tend to tense up whenever I train alone.
That's right! DanDiva's donuts are to die for too!
That's right! Even police chiefs like their summer vacations.
That's right. Ever since we met, your father hasn't broken a single promise with me, and he never tells any lies either.
That's right. Ever since we me your father hasn't broken a single promise with me, and he never tells lies either.
That's right. Every previous girl has made such cute posters, too.
That's right. Everything I've done wasn't for nothing.
That's right, excitement.
That's right. Express with every part of your bodies.
That's right. For example, chocolate is high in calories and fat, but it has antioxidants, increases your concentration ability, and is overflowing with fiber and minerals.
That's right, got a problem?!
That's right, Grandma.
That's right here in the plan.
That's right, Hidden Talents Galore.
That's right! Hoshimiya-senpai, are you heading out for work?
That's right. How did you find out?
That's right, I almost forgot to ask about the rare cards you gave to Aoi.
That's right, I can do it here!
That's right. I can still remember you singing for us like it was yesterday.
That's right, Ichigo.
That's right, Ichigo's graduating now...
That's right, I don't really get how to use my entire body just to make a single expression.
That's right. I don't want people to think that I was chosen for this role simply because I'm Kurebayashi Karen's daughter.
That's right. I don't want people to think that I was chosen simply because I'm Kurebayashi Karen's daughter.
That's right! If I'm more famous, I should be able to get a lot more different job offers.
That's right! If you pass this audition, you'll be able to form a unit with Mizuki-san!
That's right, I get nervous every single time.
That's right! I-It's the...
That's right! I know exactly how you feel.
That's right! I'll do my best to become Queen!
That's right. I made it myself.
That's right! I'm a student here too!
That's right. I'm getting interviewed about DreAca's idols later.
That's right! In drama, you act as the cool Shion-sama.
That's right. In that case, you should probably go for some sort of flashy coord.
That's right. I really like our "let's shine".
That's right. It might be best to tell you about it now.
That's right. It might be something it would be good for me to tell you about.
That's right, it's all based around you as the protagonist.
That's right. It's all over if you give up.
That's right, it's a lot of hard work.
That's right. It's important to always follow your dreams.
That's right, it's nothing to worry about.
That's right, it's not like Yurika-sama doesn't not think the same way after all.
That's right. It's the legendary idols, Hime and Miya.
That's right. It's the same brand that wanted you to be their image model a while back.
That's right. It's time for Tristar to make its comeback!
That's right, it's you.
That's right, it was exactly like you said earlier.
That's right. I've spent too much time being stained by the sun.
That's right. I wanted Sena-san to give it a try.
That's right. I wanted Sena-san to try it out.
That's right. I was sent to this school as a spy by Johnny Schwartz, the dance master I so respect.
That's right. I was sent to this school as a spy by Johnny Schwarz, the dance master I so respect.
That's right... I wonder what kind of idols we'll be a year from now.
That's right. I, Yurika-sama, was personally invited to come.
That's right, Juri-chan.
That's right. Let's go ahead and change the third one to a Normal Appeal instead.
- That's right. Mikuru-san, you're still a gardener on top of being an idol.
That's right, Mizuki-san!
That's right! New Year's Eve means the national event, the Red-White Aikatsu Battle!
That's right. Next year will be my true test.
That's right! Noelle is our secret weapon!
That's right! Once I'm famous, a lot of new opportunities will open up to me.
That's right! Once I showed them the prototypes and explained our intentions, everyone willingly gave their okay!
That's right. Otome-chan will be tough to beat.
That's right. Please tell us about the first time you met Mikuru-san.
That's right. Please tell us how you met Mikuru-san.
That's right! PowaPuri is Love You!
That's right. Ran, are you going to do the special training with us?
That's right. Rather than fearing failure, it's more like you to go all out and overdo yourself a bit.
That's right. Rather than thinking, I'll just run with all my might!
That's right. Riding the wave of popularity following their Partner's Cup victory, Double M is coming in hot!
That's right. Riding the wave of their victory during the Partner's Cup, Double M really is every which way you look.
That's right, Seira.
That's right. She came from Kobe's Etoile Institude, and her name is Kurisu Ko...
That's right. She'll always be herself.
That's right. She's from Kobe's Etoile Institude, and her name is Kurisu Ko...
That's right. So...
That's right! That's definitely something PowaPuri can do!
That's right. That's why I was so happy when you talked about your own experience.
That's right. That's why we want to do anything we can to help her get one.
That's right. That was our team's dream.
That's right! The DanDiva donuts are to die for too!
That's right. The sponsors have been watching your auditions and specifically asked for you three.
That's right! The very same famous actress!
That's right, they did.
That's right. They're the legendary idols Hime and Miya.
That's right, they were long since retired by the time I was a toddler.
That's right! This isn't a parting, but a promise for the future.
That's right! This isn't the first time I just couldn't do something.
That's right. This is the first job I want you to take on as high school students.
That's right, this Yurika-sama was personally invited to come.
That's right. Three years ago, I was once refused by Kayoko-san.
That's right. We can only shine because of our efforts behind the scenes.
That's right! We can't give up here!
That's right! We can watch it in our room.
That's right. We figured that since you know so much about fashion, you'd know exactly how to maximize costume cuteness.
That's right. We love hearing back what everyone thinks about the messages we try to convey.
That's right! We're counting on you, Demon Coach.
That's right. We're looking forward to encountering idols from all around the country.
That's right. We're looking forward to meeting idols from all around the country.
That's right! We're supposed to learn what we can from Soleil, and figure out how we can continue to grow.
That's right, we should probably have a unit name.
That's right, we've got two Starlight Queens on our side.
That's right. We were just talking about how we need to feature Aikatsu8 in our next edition.
That's right! Whenever I see a Special Appeal, it feels like my heart stops and I forget to breathe!
That's right. You are all upperclassmen now, so I believe it would be a good experience to interact with your juniors more.
That's right! You can leave that totally up to PowaPuri!
That's right. You have a job offer.
That's right. You know who I am?
That's right, you must all love dresses too.
That's right. You recognize who I am?
That's seriously special!
That's Shibuki Ran.
That's Shinjou-senpai's!
That's so adult.
That's so cool!

That's something I can understand.
That's something I'm very envious of.
That's something new.
That's something special!
That's something special.
That's something we all realized after we formed our unit.
That's something you don't see every day.
That's somethin' special!
That's some yummy-looking chocolate!
That's so much data!
That's so nerve-wracking!
That's so nice.
That's so pretty!
"That's so pretty..." - Back then, I never dreamed that I would ever get the chance to wear such an amazing dress.
That's Sora-chan and Maria-chan.
That's so right!
That's so strange. The dress Sena-san fixed definitely got delivered.
That's so strange. They should've just arrived after being fixed by Sena-san.
That's so useful! It really gets my blood moving.
That's so you.
That's Starlight Academy's ideal.
That's Starlight Academy's purpose.
That's still bothering you?
That's strange.
That's super duper amazing!
That's super-duper amazing!
That's super harsh!
That's the "Actress of Seven Faces" for you.
That's the answer I was expecting.
That's the Beautiful Blade for you.
That's the bell we used to ring when a new order came in for the chef!
That's the bell we used to ring whenever an order came through for the chef!
That's the best dress I've ever seen in my life!
That's the best part!
That's the best part about her.
That's the best possible way to show everyone Aoi-neesan's appeal!
That's the candidness I was talking about.
That's the Christmas tree that Yuna-chan was talking about!
That's the concept Masquerade had in mind.
That's the Constellation Appeal.
- That's the direction where a goddess called Toshitokujin currently lives, - That's the direction where a goddess called Toshitokujin is, Huh? Nothing.
That's the direction where a goddess called Toshitokujin lives at the moment, so you face that way and make a wish while eating your ehomaki.
That's the energy drink you do commercials for.
That's the essence of an idol.
That's the first I've heard of it.
That's the first time you've said that to me!
That's the formula for us to share in this happiness tanoshimi wakete ureshisa fueru If we spread the fun, we will all be happier tanoshimi wakete ureshisa fueru If we spread the fun, we will all be happier daisuki minna daisuki I love you, I love everyone daisuki minna daisuki
That's the fun part, how each trip is different.
That's the good part.
That's the good part about her.
That's the greatest spice of them all.
That's the Ichigo that I love.
That's the ideal Masquerade was striving for.
That's the keystone of this promotion.
That's the kind of idol I want to be.
That's the kind of Starlight Queen I want to be!
That's the last audition we've got for a while.
That's the legendary dorm...
That's the legendary oxygen mask she used to infiltrate Dream Academy in the past!
That's the limit of her exchange period..
That's them!
That's them.
That's the mark of a top actress, isn't it?
That's the meaning behind it.
That's the meaning I want it to have.
That's the most exciting part!
That's the most important ability in order to use Appeals at any time.
That's the most important thing.
That's the one problem.
That's the one thing I have absolute confidence in!
That's the only building around here it could be.
That's the only way up the winding road to be the idol of everyone's eye.
That's the outline for 2wingS outfits that we want to ask of you, Amahane-san, Makina-san.
That's the perfect expression!
That's the place you went to meet the designer for Angely Sugar, right?
That's the plan for the 2wingS outfits we're asking you for, Amahane-san and Makina-san.
That's the power of fashion.
That's the promise we made to each other sore ga anata to no yakusoku That's the promise we made to each other sore ga anata to no yakusoku We did it!
That's the reason I became an idol.
That's the reason I came to this school.
That's the reason I can work so hard.
That's the reason I decided to try out for this role.
That's the reason we're so determined in our training and lessons.
That's the reason you have this opportunity.
That's the rule.
That's the same as us!
That's the same as when you're on stage.
That's the same thing I'm trying to achieve as an idol.
That's the same with me!
That's the scariest garden in the world.
That's the side of Ichigo-tan that Otome loves best.
That's the Snow Relay Project!
That's the spirit!
That's the spirit, Kurosawa-honey.
That's the Starlight Tiara!
That's the unpredictability I was talking about.
That's too bad.
That's too bad...
That's too harsh, Ran.
That's too late.
That's too little impact, yeah.
That's too many!
That's too much to ask for...
That's too reckless.
That's top secret.
That's totally ok-ok-okay!
That's totally possible!
That's true.
That's true, but...
That's true, but even more amazing is that Mizuki-chan's going to face every single student alone.
That's true, but I also think that Ichigo-chan and the girls will benefit from this too.
That's true, but I owe it all to Minami.
That's true, but so's the amount of pain she looks like she's in.
That's true. By that time, all I remembered about her was that subpar performance.
That's true. I can't see it any other way.
That's true. This is, like, where the two of us first met.
That's true. This is totally where the two of us first met.
That's true. We're still far from becoming the Queen ourselves, but I'm not about to let that stop me.
That style really suits you.
That sucks!
That's unbelievable.
That's unexpectedly normal.
That's unfortunate.
That super cool Aoi-senpai has a leaf stuck in her hair.
That sure was close.
That sure was fun.
That sure was scary.
That surprised me.
That's us.
That's very true.
That's weird.
That's weird, I was certain this was the right way.
That's we we do these guerilla concerts once in a while.
That's what a unit is!
That's what being an idol means to me.
That's what excites me the most.
That's what I believe.
That's what I believe to be the best thing about Ichigo-chan.
That's what I call Oozora...
That's what I can say now because of the time I've put into Aikatsu.
That's what I expected.
That's what I find so great about you!
That's what I like about Hoshimiya-senpai.
That's what I'm going for.
That's what I'm talking about!
That's what I said. You need to smile for all those people.
That's what I think.
That's what I think he was talking about.
That's what it means to be an idol!
That's what it means to be a super idol.
That's what it means to be a super-idol.
That's what it seems like, but she really reminds me of Ichigo from a year or so back.
That's what I wanted to ask about!
That's what I wanted to hear!
That's what I wanted to hear.
That's what Juri has in mind for her unit, right?
That's what made me realize that this is my battle song.

That's what they told me.
That's what they told me, too. I'm not even sure what I'll be helping with.
That's what we call omelettes in Spain.
That's what we should aim for.
That's what what is?
That's what you'd normally think, right?
That's what you get for misspeaking.
That's what you wanted to say, right?
That's when I decided!
That's when I decided that I couldn't let her out of my sight, and I never have.
That's when I decided to become an idol, just like Masquerade.
That's when I found Ebipon.
That's when I got the idea of being a princess who looked up to that gallant figure.
That's when I learned about the man behind Masquerade's choreography.
That's when I ran into the man responsible for Masquerade's choreography.
That's when I realized.
That's when I remembered talking to Kaede-chan about her time in America.
That's when I started to be my current cheerful self.
That's when it hit me!
That's when my secret lessons began.
That's when my wind blew!
That's when the wind blew for me!
That's when things changed.
That's when we use acting, CG, animations, and scenery to put the world of the video on full display.
That's when you dance and walk in rhythm with the song.
That's where Green Grass-sama...
That's where it was written.
That's where they decide the year's theme.
That's where two different schools trade students for a while, right?
That's where two schools each send one student to each other, right?
That's where we'll be training?
That's where you come in. Each of you will be assigned as a trainer to one new student.

Up until now, the Twinkle Star Cup has been my goal, but beyond that goal, a new start is waiting!
Up until recently, we barely even knew each other.
Up until then, I had never worn such colorful outfits before, so I decided to wear them for my next performance.

Well, at least she didn't hurt herself.
Well, back during the the Tristar audition, and when us three were alone, - and even after Mizuki left, you've kept your vampire act up.

Well if that's an option...
Well, if that's how you feel...
Well, if you're enjoying it from the bottom of your heart, your fans might enjoy themselves too.
Well, I get where you're coming from, but you can't possibly carry all that.
Well, I guess I always try to work hard.
Well, I guess... I like both of them.
Well, I guess that's how their unit shows affection...

Well, I slid down mountains, not slides.
Well? Isn't it cute?
Well, I suppose...
Well, I suppose I have nothing to hide now that you've found me.
Well, I suppose I wasn't not looking forward to this.

Well, it's not like Seira needs my data to be a top idol.
Well, I've never been on a date before...

Well, we became such close friends after our time together during the Partner's Cup.
Well we can't just leave her alone.
Well, we got to actually go in the hot springs this time.
Well, well, Madoka. You're a fast learner.
Well, whatever.
Well, whatever. We're competing again this year, Ran.
Well, when you're at a hot springs, it'd be rude not to do it.
Well, when you're at a hot springs, it'd be rude not to play.
We'll work hard to deliver dreams to all of you!
Well would you look at that.
Well yeah, at the moment.
Well yeah, right now.

Well you know, I was immediately taken by these teacups when I saw them in an antique shop.
Well you know, I was playing soccer with Raichi and his friends and I just got really into it.
Well you know, this beautiful rainbow appeared in the fountain.
Well, you'll find out when we get there.

We made a whole cake, after all.
We made buttered potatoes, meat and potatoes, and all sorts of other potato dishes and had a party.
We made enough tea for you as well.
We made it!
We made it.
We made it for you ourselves.
We made it this far because we have some sort of aptitude as idols.

We made so many memories.
We made some good ones thanks to Ran.
We made sure to memorize all the Aikatsu Sensei role's lines too, didn't we?

We made yet another friend when our Luminas tour reached Osaka.
We made you chocolate with all of our hearts again this year.
We make it.
We make this at home a lot, and I really like pudding myself.
We managed to get the job, after all.
We managed to knock quite a few out.
We may all be idols, but we're also friends.
"We may be classmates who get along well, but my one and only idol is Aoi-neesan!" Did I get it right?
"We may be friendly classmates, but my one and only idol is Aoi-neesan!" Did you grow again?
We may change, but there are some things that'll always stay the same.

WM is too incredible.
WM! Let's shine!
WM, Love You.
WM's performance was breathtakingly amazing!
WM's performance was overwhelming, but I'm sure Seira and Ichigo-chan will be up to the challenge!
WM took complete control of the atmosphere.
WM wanted to face off against the strongest opposition possible, so they requested Starlight Academy and Dream Academy to each put forward an idol.
WM will accept the most capable opponents you can bring us.
WM will use these dresses in the Twinkle Star Cup to face 2wingS.
Woah!
Woah, hang on there.
Woah, it's Shibuki Ran-chan!
Woah, my friends would flip if they heard about this!

Yeah!
Yeah!!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah...
Yeah...?
Yeah, a car.
Yeah. A classmate of Ichigo-chan, and known as an idol expert...
Yeah. A classmate of Ichigo-chan, and known as the Idol Professor.
Yeah, a consummate professional.
Yeah, actually...
Yeah. After spending every morning and night together, I can tell when you're having a good day.
Yeah, a hearty welcome!
Yeah, a lot.
Yeah. Also, looking at them, Ichigo's rice scoop sure went lots of places.
Yeah, amazing.
Yeah! And Akari-chan, it was your own initiative to come here.
Yeah, and Akari-chan really showed her determination.
Yeah, and at the end of our journey...
Yeah! And because of all the courses, we have lots of choices!
Yeah, and even that first decision to pass Akari-chan was the first step of your production.
Yeah. And even though I just had dinner, I kind of got the urge to eat some Pop'n Popcorn.
Yeah, and ever since then, she hasn't given up her throne as the top idol even once.
Yeah, and ever since then she's been sitting on the throne of top idol.
Yeah, and her Dreamy Crown dress was perfect.
Yeah, and he said he's really close to his ideal design.
Yeah, and he said he was really close to perfecting the design.
Yeah. And I may not be Ichigo, but I was moved.
Yeah, and I'm gonna head right for the goal with my song Hello Hello and the Street Art coord.
Yeah! And I'm shaking in anticipation to see what Double M's going to do...
Yeah, and instead of us...
Yeah, and it almost always snows on Christmas Eve.
Yeah, and it felt great.
Yeah. And it felt like one of those "it just happened" things that you always do, Ichigo.
Yeah, and it looks like she's getting more appearances too.
Yeah, and it looks like she's getting more screentime too.
Yeah, and it's even better when you have sakura mochi go to along with it!
Yeah, and it's just the first of many on my way to being a singer.
Yeah, and it's perfect to help me bring out the brilliance of this dress. I'll need to keep up with the hype!
Yeah, and let's include our performance in that too.
Yeah, and like how you always get carried away with these things.
Yeah. And looking back now, we've learned so much from our senpai like Mizuki-san and Ema-san.
Yeah! And love is forbidden, you mustn't go to the bathroom, and you have to go to sleep holding a teddy bear!
Yeah, and my dad would always read his storybooks about soil to me too.
Yeah, and no matter what Ema-san wears, she can always make her clothes sparkle.
Yeah! And not only are they stylish, but because of Sonny-san's experience as a dancer, they're also super easy to move around in!
Yeah. And one day, the idols you raise will wear the dresses I make.
Yeah, and our feelings will always connect us.
Yeah, and she even reserved such a large stadium.
Yeah, and she was strong enough to even make her very own brand, Love Moonrise.
Yeah, and STAR☆ANIS's symbol is really cool too!
Yeah, and thank you so much for taking this audition.
Yeah, and that Dreamy Crown dress was perfect for her.
Yeah, and the biscuit accessories are a great accent.
Yeah! And their performance's always something special!
Yeah, and then we'll get to making your unit name.
Yeah! And the same goes for you two.
Yeah, and though we might not have much time, let's spend every single day training.
Yeah. And wasn't that surprising?
Yeah. And weren't you surprised?
Yeah, and we're unstoppable now that we've got Ran.
Yeah, and you caught us at the right time.
Yeah, and you wouldn't want to miss their hosting.
Yeah, Angely Sugar has always been out here.
Yeah. Anna-san the designer wanted me to act as a teacher for the younger models.
Yeah. An offer came for you honeys.
Yeah. Aoi-neesan's is...
Yeah. Apples play an important part in Snow White.
Yeah, as big as your head!
Yeah, as bright as a star!
Yeah, as the three of us.
Yeah! At least, that's how I've fallen more in love with STAR☆ANIS.
Yeah, a ton.
Yeah! At the upcoming Starlight Queen Cup, live commentary will be provided by Beautiful Moon!
Yeah, at the very least she was definitely complimenting us.
Yeah, back when I failed my first exams for Starlight Academy.
Yeah, believe in us!
Yeah! Both of you already have one, right?
Yeah! Both of you already have them, right?
Yeah, but...
Yeah. But also, I'm kind of concerned about how I'll fare tomorrow.
Yeah, but being tickled by Ichigo made me realize.
Yeah, but even besides that, I'm more concerned about how I can become Seira-chan's perfect partner, like Double M are.
Yeah, but if I remember correctly...
Yeah. But I just can't hold back this excitement!
Yeah. But I'm still worried.
Yeah, but I still don't have one yet.
Yeah, but it might be even better if you stretch your arms out at the end.
Yeah, but it's fun.
Yeah, but still.
Yeah, but still...
Yeah, but still, I...
Yeah, but then you'd be forced to face the extent of your abilities.
Yeah, but what's really on my mind is how I'm going to be Seira-chan's perfect partner the way Double M are for each other.
Yeah, cafe au lait would definitely be better.
Yeah. Come see me if you ever need help with anything.
Yeah, couldn't have said it better myself.
- Yeah, deep in the heart of the city!
Yeah, definitely!
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, doesn't this make you excited?
Yeah, do your best!
Yeah! DreAca's idols are the best!
Yeah! Dresses give us strength!
Yeah, eating my Papa's food always raises my spirits.
Yeah, especially since I couldn't have chosen this set without you.
Yeah, especially since I could've have gone with this without you.
Yeah, especially this year.
Yeah. Ever since I started my Aikatsu, it's been a series of fun and special things!
Yeah, everyone's keeping a close watch on it.
Yeah, exactly! It makes my heart throb!
Yeah, far above them!
Yeah, finally.
Yeah, for about an hour.
Yeah, GJ.
Yeah, go for it!
Yeah, good idea!
Yeah, good job.
Yeah, good luck!
Yeah. Good luck.
Yeah, got it.
Yeah! Happy Merry Christmas!
Yeah. Headmistress Orihime is doing what she can, but still nothing...
Yeah, he did.
Yeah, he even seems...
Yeah, he'll be the one making our unit dresses for the Great Starlight School Festival.
Yeah, he said it's alright to take stargrapes from the village.
Yeah. He said there's not much time left until the wedding.
Yeah, he's Palm-chan the parrot.
Yeah, he's Parm-chan the parrot.
Yeah. He's the vocalist and the leader.
Yeah-hoo!
Yeah. Hoshimiya Ichigo-chan, right?
Yeah, Hoshimiya-san called me here.
Yeah! Hoshimiya-senpai is all about scaling cliffs!
Yeah. How about it?
Yeah. I always get really jealous when I see everyone else go down the slide, and I tried to climb up over and over, but I've still never done it.
Yeah, I am.
Yeah! I became an idol because I wanted to stand on stage, unchained by any instrument.
Yeah, I can just feel your confidence.
Yeah, I can kind of understand it, but I'm not sure how to put it into practice.
Yeah! I can't believe it!
Yeah, I can't thank you enough!
Yeah! I can't wait to meet everyone there.
Yeah. Ichigo hasn't changed, in a good way.
Yeah, I completely understand your feelings, Tsubaki-chan.
Yeah, I could feel it all!
Yeah, I couldn't have said it better.
Yeah! I couldn't help but be entranced like I used to be watching you two on TV.
- Yeah. I'd been an idol for so long that I couldn't stop trying to ready between the lines.
- Yeah. I'd been an idol for so long that I started accepting things as how they've always been.
Yeah. I'd been an idol for so long that I unconsciously started to try not to rock the boat.
Yeah, I'd feel bad for him then.
Yeah, I'd have no complaints if she won.
Yeah. I didn't watch it live, but it was on the Internet.
Yeah. I'd like to come with you, but I need to film off-set today.
Yeah! I'd love if our final stage was on a white Christmas.
Yeah, I'd never forget!
Yeah, I do.
Yeah. I don't mind, but...
Yeah, I don't think I can keep up with her power.
Yeah. I don't think that it wasn't there, at least.
Yeah. I even practiced as much as I could...
Yeah, if all of us were to show up together...
Yeah, I feel like cheering them on now.
Yeah! I feel like we'll be able to fly anywhere with these wings.
Yeah! I felt my heart skip a beat.
Yeah. I felt that it didn't suit the new decor, so I gave it to a regular who said she wanted it.
Yeah. I felt that it wouldn't suit the renovation, I removed the omelettes bonding you all with my father.
Yeah, I figured.
Yeah. I focus only on them, and think about exactly what kind of flowers they really want.
Yeah. If Sora wore this, she could pass for a real princess.
Yeah, if Sora wore this she'd pass for a real princess anywhere.
Yeah. If the shoot goes even slightly over, there's no way I'll make it.
Yeah. If the shooting goes even slightly over, there's no way I'll make it.
Yeah. If we can find the waffle place Mizuki-san told me about, her agency should be right there.
Yeah. If we can find the waffle place, we should be able to figure out where Mizuki-san's agency is.
Yeah. If you're in, then let's both try our best.
Yeah, I got a message from them earlier.
Yeah, I guess you're right!
Yeah, I had a blast!
Yeah. I had a lot of fun encountering so many people.
Yeah, I had a seaweed bento there.
Yeah, I haven't seen Mizuki-san make that expression in a long time.
Yeah, I heard from over here.
Yeah, I heard the staff talking about how the typhoon'll probably affect us.
Yeah, I heard the staff talking about how the typhoon will probably affect us.
Yeah, I hope I wasn't overstepping my bounds.
Yeah. I hope we're able to leave our fans with some good memories.
Yeah, I just finished up a song recording.
Yeah. I just hope that she sees it.
Yeah. I kind of understand, but I'm not sure how to put it into practice.
Yeah, I knew it as soon as I saw it.
Yeah, I know!
Yeah, I know! I can't even imagine what you'd be like when you're angry.
Yeah, I know she'll be here.
Yeah, I know we can!

Yeah, I'm sure it'll come in use.
Yeah, I'm sure Mizuki-san did this with the intention of helping all of them grow.
Yeah, I'm sure Rin-chan's planning to.
Yeah, I'm sure Rin-chan's trying her hardest.
Yeah. I'm sure that Ichigo will become an even more amazing idol.
Yeah. I'm sure the bride will...
Yeah, I'm sure we will!
Yeah, I'm too busy for that.
Yeah! I'm way too excited to see everyone's Aikatsu!
Yeah! Info really travels fast through KiraKiratter!
Yeah. Instead of worrying about being eloquent or saying the right thing, we should focus on our feelings.
Yeah! In the same way that Mizuki-san wanted to surpass Masquerade, I want to advance towards the unknown future!
Yeah! In the same way that Mizuki-san wants to surpass Masquerade, I want to advance towards my unknown future!
Yeah. I owe it all to you for letting me sing without hesitation.
Yeah. I practiced as much as I could...
Yeah, I promise!
Yeah! I realized that it's only because you're at DreAca that you're the way you are.
Yeah, I really am!
Yeah, I really need to brush up on that stuff.
Yeah, I really saw the suspect.
Yeah, I really want to!
Yeah, I really want to see them now.
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah! I saw you on TV!
Yeah, I seriously can't wait to start my lessons with Hoshimiya Ichigo.
Yeah! I should start keeping a log of interesting things for the next time I'm on.
Yeah, I slimmed down in time for the audition.
Yeah, isn't it?
Yeah. I started Aikatsu way after all you did.
Yeah. I started Aikatsu way after you all did.
Yeah, I sure learned a lot.
Yeah, it blows away both cold and heat!
Yeah, it changes a little every day.
Yeah, it couldn't be, it just couldn't be.
Yeah, it couldn't be. It just couldn't be.
Yeah, it does feel that way.
Yeah, it'd really hurt if you got hit by one.
Yeah. It even comes through in all the recordings they left.
Yeah! It feels like a dream!
Yeah, it feels like a place newlyweds would live in.
Yeah, it feels like this is "the one".
Yeah, it fits you really well.
Yeah, I think everyone had a lot of fun.
Yeah, I think so too.
Yeah, I think we were really able to entertain them.
Yeah. I think you'd look great in Bohemian Sky clothes.
Yeah, I though it was pretty good.
Yeah, I though it was pretty nice.
Yeah. I thought so much that my stomach's hit its limit.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It kind of makes me feel like I'm a real idol now.
Yeah, it'll be fun!
Yeah! It'll be on the net.
Yeah! It made him look like a real teacher.
Yeah! It made him looks like a real teacher.
Yeah, it makes me happy too!
Yeah... it may be unbelievably crazy, but I'll do it!
Yeah, it must've been back then.
Yeah, I totally understand how you feel, Tsubaki-chan.
Yeah, I totally understand you!
Yeah, it really tastes like it'd be good for me.
Yeah, it really was.
Yeah! It's a dress you'd dance with a prince in!
Yeah, it's a first for me too.
Yeah, it's a fun spread that's very much like you all.
Yeah, it's AiKara. We can take turns practicing.
Yeah! It's a lot easier to wake up too.
Yeah, it's an array of fun, just like you all.
Yeah, it's a two-person audition with Aoi.
Yeah, it's a weight off my shoulders.
Yeah, it's because of what Otome-senpai told me.
Yeah. It's been airing for more than ten years, and it gets great ratings.
Yeah! It's befitting a dance with a prince!
- Yeah! It's fresh and feels right!
Yeah! It's fresh and it feels just right!
- Yeah! It's fresh and sharp!
Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun with Mizuki-san there!
Yeah, it's great!
Yeah. It's hard to explain, but this song will light my...
Yeah, it's Hoshimiya Ichigo-chan!
Yeah. It's just that the sun's so bright you can't see them.
Yeah. It's just... the first time I wore Spicy Ageha, my heart started pounding, and it was like I became a different person.
Yeah! It's like a battle for the top of the idol world!
Yeah, it's like I'm drowning in them.
Yeah! It's like she's stepped into a new world!
Yeah, it's like the entire studio is revolving around Ran.
Yeah, it's my time to shine!
Yeah, it's not a big deal.
Yeah, it's not bad.
Yeah, it's not like a girl's room at all!
Yeah, it's on me now.
Yeah. It's our job to light a fire under Aikatsu.
Yeah, it's perfect.
Yeah, it's really cute!
Yeah, it's really good.
Yeah! It's really really special!
Yeah! It's showtime!
Yeah, it's something special!
Yeah, it's something special.
Yeah, it's starting.
Yeah, it started right in the middle of my hiatus.
Yeah, it's the birthplace of Dreamy Crown dresses. It sounds lovely.
- Yeah, it's the heart of the city!
Yeah, it's the same as in Starlight.
Yeah, it's this...
Yeah, it's time!
Yeah, it suits you perfectly.
Yeah. It's unfortunate, but she was captivated by a jersey.
Yeah. It's unfortunate, but she was seized by a jersey.
Yeah, it sure is.
Yeah, it's wonderful.
Yeah, it tastes like it's really good for me.
Yeah, it took us a while before we partnered up too.
Yeah, it was a blast!
Yeah, it was a great performance.
Yeah, it was a huge success.
Yeah, it was a mightily fine performance!
Yeah, it was back then.
Yeah; it was beautiful.
Yeah. It was beautiful.
Yeah, it was seriously something special.
Yeah, it was such a fulfilling concert.
Yeah, it was the same for me.
Yeah, it was the year right before she entered Starlight Academy.
Yeah, it was tons of fun!
Yeah, it would've been cool for Rin to come, but I never expected to be able to talk about her with Luminas themselves!
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah, I've already beat the dance deep into my head.
Yeah. I've always been jealous watching everyone else go down the slide, Then it's a promise between us!
Yeah. I've got another concert in Berlin coming right up, though.
Yeah. I've gotten over my nerves, and I owe it all to you.
Yeah! I've got the concept for my unit down pat!
- Yeah! I've got the concept for my unit is down pat!
Yeah! I've just gotta know exactly how it clicked for them!
Yeah. I've wanted that brand for a while now.
Yeah. I've wanted this brand since forever ago.
Yeah. I wanna do as many jobs as I can to prepare for the Starlight Queen Cup.
Yeah. I wanna do as many jobs as we can to prepare for the Starlight Queen Cup.
Yeah! I wanted to build some strength on the way.
Yeah. I want to become a muse who can make fans and designers alike shine even more brilliantly!
Yeah, I want to be more like her.
Yeah. I want to bring happiness to all of Japan.
Yeah. I want to design a wedding dress myself sometime in the future.
Yeah. I want to energize all of Japan.
Yeah! I want to give everyone an entertaining show.

Yeah! I want to wear a Vivid Kiss Premium dress for it!
Yeah, I was.
Yeah, I was feeling a bit antsy.
Yeah, I was invited.
Yeah! I was moved by how much they cheered me on.
Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that much while we were running, and I feel like I can sleep well now.
Yeah! I was really surprised.
Yeah, I was the one who took her there.
Yeah, I was thinking.
Yeah. I was thinking about the line you mentioned yesterday...
Yeah, I will.
Yeah. I wonder who it is?
Yeah, I wonder who'll be performing.
Yeah, I won't let you down.
Yeah, I won't lose.
Yeah! I won't lose!
Yeah, I won't miss it.
Yeah, just a bit more!
Yeah, just before Otome.
Yeah, just check out those slender legs.
Yeah. Just like being good at singing or dancing, having a strong character is another type of weapon for idols.
Yeah, just like that!
Yeah. Just listening to them talk probably entranced the audience so much they forgot I messed up.
Yeah, just look at these seedlings.
Yeah! "Kawaii" is a word used throughout the world!
Yeah. Kiriya Aoi-chan and Shibuki Ran-chan are third-years.
Yeah. Kokone-chan was insisting on a cute dress for Miyabi-chan to wear.

Yeah, like water, you're...
Yeah, looking good!
Yeah, looks fantastic!
Yeah, looks like it.
Yeah, love you.
Yeah, Luminas is great!
Yeah. Luminas, Nina-san, we believe in you!
Yeah. Maybe it's because she's both an idol and a designer.
Yeah, me neither.
- Yeah, mensore!
Yeah, me too!
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, Mikuru-san's name...
Yeah! Mikuru-san was really amazing!
Yeah! Miyabi-chan is always so cool.
Yeah! Miyabi-chan's gonna wear it for our debut live!
Yeah. Miyabi-chan told me that doing this exchange program wasn't her decision.
Yeah. Miyabi-chan told me that she didn't decide to do this exchange on her own.
Yeah. Mizuki-chan is here too, huh.
Yeah! Mizuki-san always accepts our full efforts.
Yeah! Mizuki-san always manages to outshine even our brightest efforts.
Yeah, Mizuki-san really is amazing!
Yeah. Mizuki-san's quite daring, don't you think?
Yeah, more or less.
Yeah, more than anything else.
Yeah! My dad helped me pack it up.
Yeah. My dance lesson with Rin-chan got canceled.
Yeah. My dance lesson with Rin-chan got cancelled.
Yeah! My face looks really accurate.
Yeah! My favorite brand, Angely Sugar, and your favorite, Swing Rock...
Yeah, my first impression was that I couldn't let her out of my sight.
Yeah, my head's still up in the clouds.
Yeah! My heart was aflutter with memories of my childhood.
Yeah, my sister is acting completely different from usual.
- Yeah, my sister looks completely different from usual.

Yeah, now we get going for real.
Yeah. Now what should we actually do?
Yeah, of course!
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, of course...
Yeah, of course it's not Ichigo.
Yeah. Oh, could it be?
Yeah. Oh, I need to tweet about entering the Pon Pon Crepe contest.
Yeah! Oh, we need to get moving.
Yeah, okay!
Yeah, Onee-chan's amazing!
Yeah, one more fold and... done.
Yeah. Only one can be the Starlight Queen or the top idol.
Yeah. Other than Sakura, we're all going to graduate from Starlight's middle school division this spring.
Yeah, please continue to be my friend.
Yeah. Plus, I also let my guard down during New Years...
Yeah, probably.
Yeah! Ran, thanks for making it.
Yeah. Rather than worrying about skills or things to say, we we should focus on our feelings.
Yeah! Reading them always makes me happy.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, really winsome.
Yeah, right?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right? Miyabi-chan put her new side on full display.
Yeah, right when I got here.
Yeah, same here.
Yeah. Same with Shion-chan.
Yeah, "seaweed bento" is the short name.
Yeah. Seeing her made me want to study acting more.
Yeah. Seeing her up close and personal reminded me of how great she really was.
Yeah. Seeing you now reminded me of that day.
Yeah, see you...
Yeah. See you next year, Ran.
Yeah, she came in like a storm.
Yeah, she changes it a little every day.
Yeah, she did.
Yeah, she did all three.
Yeah. She even raised an idol from scratch just to make her new unit.
Yeah, she even seems...
Yeah. She'll be starring in a live concert for the debut of a new lip gloss.
Yeah. She may be miles and miles ahead of me, but I'll keep moving forward here at DreAca and one day, for sure, I'll catch up to her.
Yeah. She may be so far ahead she's nearly out of sight, and one day, for sure, I'll catch up with her.
Yeah, she must be!
Yeah, she really is cute!
Yeah, she really is cute.
Yeah, she really managed to keep our eyes glued to her the entire time she was on stage.
Yeah, she really was.
Yeah, she's acting like a real princess.
Yeah, she's a doctor, but to me, she's a producer who produces cheerfulness for me.
Yeah, she said her new Constellation Premium Dress was done.
Yeah, she said that her new Constellation Dress was done.
Yeah. She said that's why she does all of her training.
Yeah. She said that's why she trains so much.
Yeah, she said that, though she was a bit nervous, she'd try to enjoy herself on air.
Yeah, she's amazing.
Yeah, she's a really reliable person.
Yeah, she seriously powered up!
Yeah! She's given us great advice for the next time we have a variety show.
Yeah. She's one of our top first-years.
Yeah, she's probably already cheering us on in her head.
Yeah, she's probably already cheering us on in her heart.
Yeah, she's really cool!
Yeah. She's really leveled up in that respect.
Yeah, she's really nice!
Yeah, she's really reliable in times like this.
Yeah, she's right.
Yeah, she's something special.
Yeah, she's taking the idol course at Osaka's renowned comedy school, Naniwa Grand Academy.
Yeah, she's the best!
Yeah, she was concerned.
Yeah. Shibuki Ran and Kiriya Aoi are third-years.
Yeah. So...
Yeah, so am I!
Yeah, so get excited!
Yeah! So I thought maybe I could ask you for some advice.
Yeah! So I thought maybe we could talk about it together.
Yeah. Soleil is a really, incredibly important unit to the three of us.
Yeah. Soleil is incredibly important to the three of us.
Yeah, somehow.
Yeah. Something like what the fans really expect of me.
Yeah, so now I'm, uh...
Yeah, so please train us to the bone.
Yeah. So she's Hoshimiya Ichigo-chan...
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Yeah, sounds interesting.
Yeah, sounds like a blast.
Yeah. Sunday's your debut, and there's not much time left.
Yeah, swoosh!
Yeah. Talk to you later.
Yeah, thanks!
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah! Thanks.
Yeah, thanks for preparing everything!
Yeah, that felt pretty good.
Yeah, that last one was great!
Yeah, that makes you sound considerate towards the viewers.
Yeah, that Mister S.
Yeah, that must be it!
Yeah, that must be it.
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, that one looks great.
Yeah, that one's really cute.
Yeah, that's about right, I can't even imagine what you'd be like when you're angry.
Yeah... that's exactly right!
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here.
Yeah, that's great!
Yeah, that's her professionalism.
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, that's my reason.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Yeah, that's our Ichigo.
Yeah, that's part's definitely the same.
Yeah, that's pretty close.
Yeah, that's really good.
Yeah, that's right!
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right! I remember that's what everyone calls you.
Yeah, that's right! I thought the same thing!
Yeah, that's right. Juri's mother is the actress Kurebayashi Karen-san.
Yeah, that's so cool.
Yeah, that's the face of a pro.
Yeah! That's the kind of thing I really love about the Aurora Fantasy world.
Yeah, that's what the Academy Mother calls it.
Yeah! That's what the Pom Pom Crepe Girl does!
Yeah! That's what you need to be the Pon Pon Crepe Girl.
Yeah, that's when you called me the Talk Show Demon.
Yeah! That's why idols are interesting!
Yeah, that thought is invaluable.
Yeah, that too.
Yeah, that was good!
Yeah, that was really overwhelming.
Yeah. That way you might even be able to make more flowers bloom.
Yeah, that would be a kindness towards the viewers as well.
Yeah, that would explain why she wasn't in my brain database.
Yeah! The atmosphere the fans bring is always something special!
Yeah! The Blue Empress coord.
Yeah. The cameraman avoids shots of her feet as much as possible to hide it.
Yeah. The cameraman follows up by avoiding shots of her feet as much as possible.

Yeah, the cutest.
Yeah. The designer, Anna-san, wanted me to act as a teacher for the younger models.
Yeah! The designer of Futuring Girl was a really nice person.

Yeah, the girls are mightily incredible.
Yeah. The last time I climbed up, there was a Christmas tree like that...
Yeah, the legendary idols, Masquerade.
Yeah! The May Queen Cup is so much fun!
Yeah, the mixture of their separate personalities creates something fresh and exciting.
Yeah, the most important thing is to give our all.

Yeah! There's nothing wrong with it.
Yeah. There was this really cool person dancing down there.
Yeah! These vampire idol honeys have attained eternal life.
Yeah! The showdown concert was really exciting, but this is going to be even better!

Yeah, the Special Appeal.
Yeah... they asked me so nicely, so...
Yeah! They can make it cute or mature!
Yeah! They can make it cuter or more mature!
Yeah, they invited me.
Yeah, they looked wonderful on you.
Yeah, they must be hard at work.
Yeah, they put me at ease.

Yeah. Though I'm still not sure if I'm really suited to be the Pon Pon Crepe Girl.
Yeah. Though it's not like we're even apart for that long, it feels like forever compared to before.
Yeah. Though it's not like we're even apart for that long, it just feels like forever compared to before.
Yeah. To be honest, I felt like we actually could've won after we put in our best effort, Not to mention Mikuru-san who can keep up with her.
Yeah. To be honest, I felt like we were going to win after all that effort we put in, so it's kind of a shock.
Yeah. To be the image girl for a shampoo brand.
Yeah! Today, Nina-chan was really crazy cute, ya know!
Yeah, today we're filming outside the city.
Yeah, together.
Yeah, tomorrow will be sunny!
Yeah, totally!

Yeah, we checked off all the boxes.
Yeah! We combine our individual parts and create something new!
Yeah! We combine our unique parts and create something new!
Yeah, we'd never get anywhere if this satisfied us.
Yeah! We encountered so many fans, and so many idols!

Yeah. We had a tea party while watching the rape blossoms.
Yeah, we had the idea that Otome was in love with him for some reason...
Yeah, we have to keep up with our new rivals.
Yeah! We have to step it up too!
Yeah. We just couldn't resist when we saw the words "Queen Cup".

Yeah, we messed up and accidentally printed too much.
Yeah! We might be able to get there if we're together.
Yeah, we might be able to make a harmony that DreAca can't by itself.
Yeah. We might not sound like poets, but I want to share the gratitude I have for my fans with them.
Yeah, we really are blessed!
Yeah, we're filming it tomorrow.
Yeah, we're on the same page.
